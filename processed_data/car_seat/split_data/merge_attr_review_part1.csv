2,3,0,0,3,,This fits perfect in our vehicle. My son always falls asleep in it. Love the cup holders too!
0,4,0,0,5,,I bought this car seat because the one I had bought the day before was not what it was made out to be and definitely didn’t recline enough and the babies head hung while sleeping and such I also wanted the quick latch system being my husband and I switch from truck I have a small suv and three girls one which is 12 and not in a car seat so she is between the booster and all in one and there wasn’t much room at all between the other seat but this seat definitely has that check off list it has the quick latch system the recline isn’t a much as the  graco  4ever but the recline is definitely better then the Evenflo  Symphony my Favorite part of the seat is that it’s slim the cup holders turn in to make more room and that quick latch system is amazing I was able to get the seat very tight and it will not move so over all  very happy with this seat I returned the other that I bought and kept this one I hope you to find this help full will add pics as soon as I get some day light out
4,4,1,1,0,,"This product fit a need, as my 5 year old needed a new car seat. I am not quite comfortable with him using a backless booster. I was specifically looking into a seat that had somewhere to secure the seatbelt. We had tried another seat, and the seat belt kept getting stuck. The red little contraption it has keeps the seatbelt in place and allows for the seatbelt to move through easily. My son is able to buckle himself in and out without my help which is a huge help! The color is modern and the seat is not bulky. Great purchase."
1,7,0,2,2,Car Seat Footrest,"My 4 year olds have been complaining about leg pain on any car trip over 30 minutes, so I found these foot rests and the boys are so excited about them. They fit fine in the third row of our suburban with Evenflo Maestro Sport booster seats. Installation was pretty easy, just took a little playing around with the different adjustments to get it right. We are going on a 4 hour trip next week, so I’ll update if there are any issues, but so far so good!"
2,4,0,0,1,,Perfect
0,7,0,2,3,,"Installation was a breeze and the carseat looked so comfortable! My son falls asleep in it everytime. I had read where this carseat was extremely bulky. I have a Nissan Murano and there is plenty of room for other backseat passengers. I bought this carseat from Amazon about two weeks ago and I checked back to see if the price was the same and it had dropped about $67 so I returned it and got a lighter color (waverly). All in all this is the best carseat out there, NO DOUBT. I have tried a few and they are either uncomfortable or I have to put towels under the carseat to get them secured. I would never think that carseats are made for you to have to put TOWELS underneath them, thats crazy! All other carseats moved around and I could never get them tight. This carseat doesn't move AT ALL!! Get it, you won't be disappointed!"
2,3,4,0,5,Cup Holder,Bought this for use on the airplane since it is very light weight. Worked great and we liked it so much we bought another for the extra car. My son likes it better than his Britax in our daily driver.
0,3,3,0,3,,"Was looking for something easy to install and this fit the bill perfectly! A little heavy but was still quick to switch from one car to another. Very nice, sleek looking. My son seems more comfortable in this one than our other one. The shoulder pieces and rubber shock absorbers are a little bulky. Other than that, I am very happy with this car seat."
0,3,4,0,0,,"This is a great car seat.  Don't bother getting a more expensive one, this one is a bargain!  It's easy to install and comfy for my son.  I recommend getting the &#34;Gunther&#34; style because it's made of a soft fabric.  I have another one of the seats in a different style that's made of a slick type of fabric.  It tends to get a little hot to the touch in the summer and cold in the winter.  The &#34;Gunther&#34; style is much more comfortable for my son."
2,3,0,0,3,,"We've had this carseat for more than a year now, and we don't recommend it to our friends. The installation is probably as difficult as any convertible seat. To get a tight fit, you basically have to lay across the carseat and tightening the anchoring system is difficult at any angle. To get it correctly installed, you have to guess where to set the anchoring strap and then try to snap the buckle in. If it's too hard, you loosen it and try again. Too loose and you unsnap it, tighten the strap and do it again. This method takes a long time, and is much more difficult than the advertised system of snapping the buckle into the seat and then tightening the strap. Like I said, though, most of the larger carseats aren't easy to install because of how bulky and awkward they are.<br />The other complaint we have with this particular carseat, which drives us crazy the most, are the harness straps. It seems so easy; you buckle up your child and pull the tightening strap to make sure they're held in safely. We had this system with our infant carseat, (Chicco Keyfit 30), and loved it. It was easy to tighten and loosen. With this carseat, we have a very difficult time tightening the harness enough to be safe. Sometimes the gap between the straps and my son's chest are large enough for me to put my hand under and I have to brace myself to make it any tighter. The booklet instructs you to tighten the carseat straps until you can't pinch them together. It is very difficult to get the straps to this point. We have tried pulling the tightening strap at different angles and made sure it wasn't tangled in any way and yet it still requires way too much arm strength to pull tight. Buckling a squirmy toddler is never fun, but this carseat just adds to the frustration.<br />The other annoyance is how close together the straps are at my son's neck. If the pads get moved or if my son pulls them off, (which is easy), he gets painful looking, red lines on the side of his neck from where the straps rubbed.<br />The reason we bought this carseat was because it was rated one of the top, safest ones and we could keep my son rear facing for longer. I feel like the design of it could be improved, though, so that reaching it's praised point of safety is easier."
4,4,1,2,0,Cup Holder,"Excellent!!  Great for the in between kids!  Looks good!  Great colors.  Bought one for myself, and my picky daughter grabbed out of my care and gave me her used one.  Apparently she like it too!"
1,5,4,0,2,,Good size to fit in a Jeep Liberty which has smaller seat depth. Also used in a Polaris Ranger UTV. Good quality and easy to get child in and out of.
2,3,0,0,2,,"I love this car seat, I have one for my 2yr old and 1yr old. They are easy to install. I only wish that it was a little more secure. When I hook the bottom, it’s secured to the metal clips in the seats but the car seat still moves from side to side. I was it to tightly secured to the seat."
0,2,1,2,0,,"This was bought at a discount through Amazon Warehouse Deals. We are thrilled to have gotten it at such a reduced price and it two days. Although the outside box was a bit damaged (as advertised), the car seat is perfect! It will work with the car bases that we already have as well as our stroller. I will definitely buy from Amazon Warehouse Deals again!"
2,4,0,0,1,,I love the durability and the soft material. It a little high so I feel like I have to pick my kid up higher to get her in it. Still worth the buy though!
0,2,1,2,0,,Fast shipping and great quality. Loved the fact that it came with the base.

My one year old loves it. It was quick and easy to install. Adjusts super easy. Definitely worth the price.<br /><br />My box came opened and damaged causing my carseat to be dirty and wet from snow melting on the box. Amazon delivery is an awful service.
4,4,0,1,0,,"Nice looking seat, but car anchor connector system is flawed. Installed seat like I normally do. I typically give a shake test after all my installs, and I realized this seat was losing tension against the seat of the car. I was able to manually pull the seat to the full extension of the anchor connectors without pressing the release button.. I have never seen this with a car seat. I reinstalled multiple times with the same results. Not good...."
1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel","We were going for a long trip abroad and we decided to get these boosters for the kids instead of renting boosters from the rental companies for an extremly high price.<br />They saved us a lot of money and room.<br />the big + is that the sit is very compact, light for traveling and easy to push into your bag/suitcase.<br />The - is that the inflation system isnt to great and anoying. Also they are not as comfy as the real boosters<br />Also they are a bit soft and obviusly not as safe as real boosteres.<br />All in all, they are a great solution as portable boosters for travling and we are very happy with them."
0,4,0,0,5,,This car seat is great.  It is pretty light and easy to install.  I would say that the release button is a bit tricky when you are trying to manage a 1 year old and pull the straps out while pressing the release.  I supposed as she gets older it will be a good thing it is not too easy to release the straps.  As far as size this thing looked to be the smallest one out there but it barely fits in my VW MK7 Golf.  The passenger seat has to be pulled up at least half way and the car seat is less than an inch from touching the passenger seat. This is in rear facing mode.  It also took a few tries to get it level since it is such a tight fit.  In the end we moved this seat to my wife's car and i havent decided if we will get a 2nd for the VW or not.
2,4,0,0,1,,I love it! I have two and would buy more!
2,3,0,0,1,,"I purchased 2 seats for my car to use with my  grandchildren. They are great, light weight and easy to install. My babies have plenty of leg room and they are both forward and rear facing so they are adaptable to the different ages of my grand babies."

0,2,1,2,0,,"Love this carseat because it comes with the piece for the winter when its cold , the only thing i did replace was the infant insert because i felt like it was kind of cheap looking and would rip or dirty easy so i bought a jj cole insert . Other then that i would highly recommend ."
1,7,0,0,2,Car seat and suitcase sold separately,It worked great and arrived fast. Simple and easy to use. Very easy to take off during security checks and put back on.
1,7,0,0,2,Car seat and suitcase sold separately,"We now have 2 of these.  They are very simple and make transporting car seats through airports manageable.  It is not uncommon to get comments like ""that is a great idea"" or ""you almost couldn't get anywhere without that.""  It is true.  We got chased off of a gate walkway because I was stopping to attach the straps and had to carry EVERYTHING by hand while my wife took the little ones.  It was only 100 feet, but it made me realize just how wonderful these things are."
2,3,3,0,3,,"As a long time fan of Britax car seats, the Click-Tight Advocate with Anti-Rebound Bar exceeds my expectations. With the many new safety features and the amazingly easy click-tight technology, I am so happy with this car seat. No more wrestling with the latch bars for this mama. With the turn of a dial, the whole seat area lifts up and you simply run the belt through the belt path, lower the seat until you hear it click and voil&agrave;, car seat installed. Safe baby, happy mama!"

0,7,0,2,0,,Carseat is very nice. Takes a lot of room so won't fit in a small car but works good in a suv.
4,4,1,1,4,"STURDY, STABLE, SECURE",Used this on a trip where we would be traveling using ride share mainly. Very easy to blow up and install in the car. Wouldn’t use it day to day but great for travel

4,4,1,1,4,"STURDY, STABLE, SECURE",Was skeptical buying these but after researching em I went ahead. And so happy I did . Love these car seats super easy to inflate and deflate love the non slip bottom great for small back seats and love the travel bag it comes with. Great purchase
4,4,0,1,0,,Such a nice seat!! He loves it!
1,5,0,0,2,,My granddaughter fits comfortably in it. It turns around and the baby can see everything. She is a happy camper. Love it! It’s nice and roomy for her. Love love love it. Thank you for making this product. Nice.
1,7,0,0,2,Car seat and suitcase sold separately,"We were going to travel across the country and I'm a big believer in having the baby have a separate seat.  We tried lugging a big britax seat on a short airplane ride by hand and it was overwhelmingly annoying.  All the baby gear is cumbersome (stroller, carry ons, car seat etc).  This little tiny strap enabled us to lug a Sunshine Radian 65 (which is narrow enough to roll down the aisle of the 767 on our rollerboard carryon luggage) with the baby in it (1 yr old).<br /><br />It definitely would be fiddly for only one parent if they were juggling child, baggage, car seat, stroller etc.  But it really worked well for us.  Practice putting it on and off.  It is definitely one of the best solutions for taking a convertible car seat on the plane if you need to bring one on your trip.  Once our baby is older, we would consider using the CARES harness.  But the car seat enabled our baby to sleep in familiar environs.<br /><br />One thing to consider is if you end up taking the baby in the car seat, they may want you to check your stroller in rather than gate check (if you use a stroller bag to protect your stroller).  We had no issues in SFO, but we ran into resistance at JFK and ended up checking the stroller in at JFK."
1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel",This is perfect for traveling or when you need to fit a car seat in the middle of 2 other car seats. We used this on a recent trip to Puerto Rico and it worked as expected. Definitely recommend this!
4,4,1,1,0,,the pad is different from one I bought at target. its more soft. overall is good

0,5,0,0,5,,"love the 4ever car seat!! It's so cushiony and sturdy! I feel like my 5 month old daughter is much safer in this seat than in the &#34;click and go&#34; style. She loves the bright color, and recline position. The cup holders are a great bonus! They hold binkys or toys now, eventually a sippy cup. Well worth the money spent, amazon never fails to provide the true quality products at a great price and FAST shipping!!!"
4,4,1,1,2,,"Love the dinosaur pattern on this booster. I have actually purchased a total of 3 of this booster, though 2 were store purchases. After needing to get another booster for Grandma, I let my son pick out the pattern and he was excited to get something besides the basic black/grey. The adjustable arm rests and cup holders are great on this booster and my son has never complained about being uncomfortable in this seat."
1,4,1,1,5,Cup Holder,"These were perfect. Exactly as described, great quality, very pleased"
1,3,0,0,5,,"We loved this car seat with our now 7 year old and love it with our 21 month old!  My only complaint about the newer technology is the rotating adjustment piece is rather stiff.  I expect this to loosen over time.  I think our son's was like this, too, 5-6 year ago.  I love being able to tighten it securely.  My biggest complaint with the strap-tightening car seats is I never feel like they are truly tight.  This one, I do, and it has great crash test ratings.<br /><br />UPDATE: A year later.  I loathe the cup holders on this thing.  Everything else is still awesome (this is our second Triumph seat and we love the adjustment mechanism).  But, the stupid elastic straps that hold a cup a guaranteed to make whatever it is supposed to be holding fall out even if you take a more gentle turn.  We always put our tot's cups on the side our 8 year old sits on and when the stupid cup falls out (and it will), he simply puts it back.  Horrible design.  BUT, we still really love the triumph seats!"
1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel","After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase two seats. Seats are easy to install but not comfortable; both of my kids are constantly moving in the seats and seem come off the seats easy even when tucked in tight."
1,5,1,1,0,,"We purchased this to fit our 49in tall son in the Volvo XC90 (2017 model). This booster does not work for this car as the headrest in the backseat has a slight forward tilt that is not adjustable. This prevents the seat from sitting flat against the cars seat back when the headrest is extended to fit the kid. The extended headrest in this Britax seat is so flimsy, I don’t see how it would provide any extra protection in a crash. It does appear to be comfy for sleeping though. We will have to return this seat sadly."
2,3,4,0,5,Cup Holder,"I had this car seat shipped to our destination when we went on a trip and I threw it away after we were dropped off at the airport for our return flight. So I bought it because it was cheap and I was going to throw it away anyway. With carseats, you definitely get what you pay for. This car seat has no padding and is pretty difficult to install, especially compared to our Even Flo Symphony, but it got the job done, and for this price, I didn't feel bad abandoning it at the airport."

4,4,0,1,0,,"We needed a car seat that can be easily removed and quickly but is very secure when needed. It also lays flat so it can go to the back of the car and doesn't bang around when driving.

4,0,4,1,3,"Removable Tray, Safety Harness, Folds for Easy Transport and Storage",I like that it's small and compact. But u hate how unsafe it makes me feel. My 6 month old was eating and leaned hard against the tray trying to reach me handing him food and it popped off! I assure you I had it on tight and all the way. Now I don't even want to use it. Maybe later when he's bigger and I can use it as a booster seat.

4,4,0,1,0,,No Isofix.<br />But comfortable with cupholder and secret space.
0,4,0,0,5,,It is a good seat once set up properly but the instruction manual is confusing and very poorly laid out. The engineering of the seat matches the writing in the manual. I question how many of thesw aren't installed correctly because of the design and instructions.
0,3,3,0,3,,It’s been quite a few years since I needed a car seat so I decided to research care seats again. Once again Britain’s convertibles stood out for safety.  This makes it the 3rd one I’ve bought! The baby loves it as he is huge for his age and made me feel better switching him early!
0,3,3,0,3,,"My baby was so whining when she sots in a baby carseat even she was small enough to fit in. So I decide tried out her sit in the the advocate carseat when she was 5 months. Very satisfied so far.  She got very well sleep and easy to put her in and out. Even easy to install with just open the carseat with a ted button. But in Texas summer weather, she got all wet in her back when she sit for few minutes. Otherwise, I love the quality. Recommend to buy this."
0,4,0,0,5,,"I ordered this car seat for my 2 year old granddaughter. Easy to install. Tells you exactly how to position it and the straps are easy to unbuckle for someone who has ""nails"" like me.  Cup holders for drinks or snacks. I recommend this seat."

0,3,0,0,3,,"We were able to get this car seat on sale just before Prime Days. I am impressed at the value. My son is large for his age, 30 inches and 23lbs at 9 months. We opted to transition him out of his infant seat and we know Britax has a great safety history, so we purchased this seat. We do not have any regrets. My son fits in it perfectly, it is a quality material, and the install was easier than the Graco Extend2Fit we purchased for our other car. My son doesn’t seem upset with the recline position and his head doesn’t bob around either. I wish we would have purchased two of these and skipped the Graco."
1,4,1,1,0,,"We have 2 MiFolds and use them regularly for travel while living in Germany. My boys are super tall for their ages (7 and 9) but still don't reach the German height limit for riding without a booster. My oldest uses his MiFold daily, but my younger one finds it uncomfortable for daily use. We flew a lot last month, and it was so nice that both their seats fit in my backpack; no carrying bulky seats to and from the States any more.<br /><br />I will say that it is a very new product, and it still has a few kinks to work out. If you're not rushed, I would see if they make any updates in the next few months. Our biggest complaint is that the red sliding guides on the sides don't 'lock' sturdily into position. It doesn't affect the belt position on the lap or shoulder, but it can be annoying.<br /><br />Our oldest has figured out how to adjust it when it slides back in. My little one says the bottom is 'spiky' and therefore prefers his cushioned booster for daily use. I find it totally worth it for travel, though. We took them on a cruise 2 months ago, and it was so nice to be able to throw them in the backpack when we got off the ship for excursions."
2,3,0,0,0,"Forward or Rear Facing Seat, Machine Washable Seat Pad, LATCH Compatible, No-Rethread Harness",Seems comfortable and obviously safety is the top priority. Only 3 stars because the straps are very frustrating. They somehow get twisted at the buckle and it takes 5-10 minutes to fix it. Happens frequently and I haven’t figured out a way to permanently fix the issue.
0,3,3,0,3,,"We love this, and now own one for each child despite the high cost of these seats. Such a snug, secure fit in our car. We had attempted to use a cheaper $80 seat, knowing that all car seats must meet safety standards, and wanting to save some money. Even being a certified passenger safety technician, I could never obtain a secure fit with the cheaper seat and (for us, in our vehicles) it simply wasn't a safe installation. Our 2 year old is at the 90th percentile for height and in the cheap seat he was right at the maximum height for the seat (rear-facing, head was an inch from the top) even though he's only 27 pounds and well within the weight limit of 40. In this Britax, he has plenty of room to grow height-wise and this seat truly accommodates tall kids. This seat is worth the price!"
4,4,0,1,0,,"Wow, I really couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Bought the Graco Affix for my four going on five year old daughter who was ready to move on from the old car seat.  Set up and install was very easy, seat is comfortable and looks to be very secure and well padded.  Just a couple comments for you while you're making your decision to purchase:<br /><br />1) I'm really happy I spent the extra money for the LATCH attachment.  I've had boosters before without it, and its just a very nice feature.  The Graco's hooks are super easy to use - much easier than the typical child car seat - and very easy to secure and tighten.  Awesome.<br /><br />2) My daughter is very petite, part of why I've waited this long to move her to a booster.  She meets the weight requirements but I was concerned about her height.  The back of the Graco is easily adjustable and the seat belt lines up properly on her frame.<br /><br />3) I do kind of prefer the hide-able cup holders that the other Graco boosters have.<br /><br />4) Keep your eye on the price.  These boosters go on sale periodically and you shouldn't have to wait long to get it at a good price.  I think it was $70 when I put it in my cart, and I finally purchased it for like $56.<br /><br />My daughter is really happy with the booster seat, glad to be sitting in the car like a &#34;big kid&#34;.  She can't quite buckle herself in yet, but she can unbuckle which is a start.  Highly recommended."

It installed very easily, The materials are all durable and washable, which is very important, and it seems very sturdy. I have a Graco Extend2fit Convertible Car Seat in my other car, and while this product is very nice, it is not as intuitive, nor does it have all of the features of the Graco, for instance:<br /><br />- The Graco has a built in level with a ball mounted on the side that tells you that you have installed it properly.<br />- Both units have an adjustable head rest, but on the Graco, the head rest height controls the shoulder strap height as well. This is very convenient.<br />- The Graco has a foot extension so you can have it set further away from the seatback to keep older kids rear facing longer with enough leg room, which is much safer.<br /><br />All in all, while not a bad product, there are other products in the $120-140 price range that seem to have more features (Safety First grow n go 3 in 1 car Sea), and for the extra $70(40 for me because I got it on sale) the Graco Extend2Fit is a better product and worth the additional cost."

1,4,1,0,3,,"My wife and I have owned 3 Britax Marathon car seats, a Britax booster, several other brand boosters, some 3-in-1 conversions, and now we were shooting for this one as it was rated well for the price.  We have 3 car seats shoved together in a Nissan Pathfinder and there simply isn't enough room for the oldest child to insert a seatbelt on his own.  We needed a harness system to handle my growing 6-yr old.  The other two are almost 3 yrs and a 5 week old.<br /><br />Overall, the seat quality is just fine.  The one struggle we deal with daily is that my 6-yr old struggles to pinch the harness buckle together to release the two metal clips.  It's not a problem for me, but it frustrates him to no end because he wants to be able to do it himself (as he does on the Britax models just fine).  I have 2 rather independent boys... and the 3rd boy will likely join the ranks.  Occasionally he'll also fight with the breast strap, even though I think he's just grasping it wrong.  If you're going to have a problem with this carseat, this is the RIGHT problem to have.  Better that the carseat hold your child tight and fast than release him/her easily.<br /><br />Other the harness release issues, the seat has worked out well so far and at least does make it so that we can have the 3 car-seat-bound boys in the car at once.  Uhh, that's rather important, I'd say.  The search for a minivan is underway -- something I never thought I'd say."

3,1,0,0,2,,"Recently purchased this carseat for my 9 month old. Although he still could fit his infant carseat, he wasn't comfortable and car rides would be a nightmare. Since installing this carseat (which took approximately 30 minutes) he enjoys car rides and surprisingly it's not as bulky as his infant car seat and is much more comfortable with the infant insert. He has to use the infant insert since his weight limit is below 25lbs. Overall, It's much more plush and he actually looks comfortable. He fits perfect and the carseat fit perfectly in my vehicle rearfacing. I have a very small crossover with very few leg room in the back which is why I opted for this carseat. It definitely is a space saver! I know several people have left reviews that indicated how difficult instillation was. I didn't find it so horrible since I watched plenty of videos and read the manual in it's entirety. I suppose the horizontal reference line and the tether anchorage system could be a learning curve since most are used to the balancing bubble and just a more straightforward car seat installation. I would definitely recommend reading the manual for setup. Other than that, I have thoroughly enjoyed this car seat and my baby has loved it just as much. Which is most important."

It was not super hard to install but we have the latch system. I will say I did want to put it in the center seat but our car only has latches on side seats and when I tried to combine them in the middle it left more than an inch of movement...so on the side she goes!<br />She is also still rear facing per the new recommendations and even with a towel wedged her wee head still flops forward when she sleeps... will be trying pillow soon.<br />I do like the room it gives her within the seat and the seat itself does not take up that much room in the back of our 4 door sedan....it still allows 2 other people to sit in the back.

Yes, it was that easy.<br />-Solid.  This seat is sturdy.  When you grab it from the top section and move it, it stays solid.  Our other seat feels flimsy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Our daughter is a petite and I have to keep adjusting the shoulder belts so they don't fall off her shoulders while tightening up the belts.  This should go away once she get's bigger (and it did)<br />-It takes a little more effort than our other seat to buckle our daughter in.  I have to adjust all the parts constantly<br />-No head cushions to keep a kids head straight when they fall asleep<br /><br />Give all of the above this is still our primary seat and I would recommend it.

1,4,4,2,3,Adjustable,"A flight from the West Coast to Michigan on my own w/3 kids on a RED EYE with a 3 Hour Layover...this cart made it possible! My 2 year old was able to sit in her carseat during our flight and she fell right to sleep. The familiarity of her carseat was so helpful and there is no way she would have stayed buckled w/o her carseat. I could not have carried her carseat w/3 kids all around the airport and there is no way I would take a stroller AND a carseat without another adult traveling w/me to help. This cart turned her carseat into a stroller and it worked great. Super easy to use. We have a Graco car seat and it fit perfectly. The car seat was too wide to &#34;roll&#34; down the airplane aisle, so I did have to unbuckle her and carry the carseat over my head through the narrow aisles. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it took a little effort to tighten it and get the carseat sitting just right on the cart without it wobbling. Our 3 hour layover was manageable because I could use it as a stroller and take her on a long walk to keep her settled and sleepy. Traveling with a wiggly toddler is so much easier with this!!"
0,5,0,0,5,,We bought this as an upgrade from our infant seat (that came with the stroller) because our little one was screaming every time we put her in the car.

It has the option to use the anchor system or seat belt (anchor is safest). We also loved that it would grow with her and we wouldn't have to buy another seat for her. I highly recommend.

1,7,0,2,3,,"This car seat is clearly safe, which is the most important thing.  It appeared to be comfortable for my child.  What i like most about this car seat is the latches in the front are very easy for an adult to snap and not so easy for a child to unsnap.  My child has used two other car seats (both Gracos) and at a  young age (less than 1 yrs old) she was able to unlatch the top part of the harness (as it did not take much pressure to unlactch it).<br /><br />It is also easy to install so if you have to move the car seat into another car you will not spend much time adjusting and tightening.<br /><br />The reason I am givign this 4 stars is because after removing the cover to wash it I noticed how cheap the cushionng material is (although it was clearly comfortable for my child).  Also, once the cover was removed I was never able to get the cover to fit back on the car seat the same.  It constantly came loose or came off.  When the car seat cover becomes loose the frame of the car seat became exposed and there is a hole between the back of the carseat frame and the side of the careseat.  My child was able to stick her arm in that little hole and got her arm stuck.  I had to pull the car over and remove her little arm from the hole."

They strap themselves first without the belt positioner, then after the seatbelt has been fastened, they will slide the belt positioner in place and lastly pull the shoulder strap tightly.

It's hard to get it to stay attached, and it often wobbles or comes off when we go around corners (to be clear, my son never rides in the seat while it's on the caddy!). Also, it's hard to attach tightly with the latch straps and then unstrap it quickly to go through security or get on the plane. This might work better with heavier carseats or the type with a closed base. Despite it's flaws, I've been traveling with this caddy for nearly two years and plan to take it on another trip later this month, so I admit that it's easy to use this than to carry even a lightweight carseat."

I could not get the angle right in my suburban for my daughter. She's 27lbs, so I am supposed to have her level with the ground, according to the line on the car seat itself. She's only 18 months, so I do have her rear-facing. I just cannot get it level with the line. I tried putting a rolled up blanket under the front to put her at the right angle, but how safe is that really? And I cannot get it where it does not move. I live out in the country. There's gravel roads and curves. I swear, her car seat slides around. It's barely noticeable, but it makes me nervous! In my husband's Nissan Sentra, it works great!! Seriously, it's great! It fits well. It doesn't slide around. Perfect angle! My mom's Odyssey, same thing! But in my Chevy Suburban, it just does not seem to work. I don't know if it's because the seats are leather or the angle of the seat.. I don't know. It just doesn't work. My husband's Nissan and my mom's Odyssey both have cloth seats too if that helps anyone to decide to buy. Overall, it's a great car seat. Don't let this deter you from buying it! It's easy to clean, easy to adjust, and I like that when she falls asleep, her head doesn't just fall forward or flop over to the side. It looks very comfortable for her. We did keep this car seat for my husband's car, and my mom has one as well. They both love it and use it often. For my suburban, I did end up buying a different one though. Hope this helps someone!"

The seat stays right into place without any play. I can see where people can complain about the headrest falling but I’m curious as to how many people leave the car seat strap in the holder constantly to strap in.

It has held up so well and has been on 8 plane rides, several cars and 4 states over those couple years. Some installs have been tricky but once you realize it needs a rolled up towel or pool noodle in some cars it works great! Seats that sit at a recline work best.

In general I like the car seat but could definitely be made better and less hazardous.

Sometimes you have to adjust the angle of the latches for a tight fit but overall it’s much easier than our other seats. The kids seem comfortable and happy in these seats, even on 10+ hour car drives.<br /><br />Over the course of the past 5 years we’ve had these seats, we’ve dealt with a couple of recalls. One of which I called about prior to the official recall release and was told that since the seat was out of warranty, it wouldn’t be covered or fixed. This specific issue was related to the locking mechanism that keeps the seat straps tightened down on the child and it was malfunctioning and completely unsafe for use. Eventually they issued a recall and it was fixed but we were unable to use the seat for nearly a year.<br /><br />The lifespan of this item is longer than many other car seats, however the warranty does not coincide with the lifespan. Meaning, you will have issues with parts and mechanisms, as well as fabric tearing and peeling and it won’t be covered by the manufacturer."

This was my second purchase of the Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat.  I'm working on replacing the car seat for my 3-year-old great-niece in three different cars. I was very impressed at all the features of this seat and I am glad that the 5-pt harness goes up to 65 lbs as I would like her in in a 5-pt harness as long as possible since it is the safest configuration. This seat has a little bit of recline adjustment which made it easier to transition her from a regular car seat.  The connecter between her legs has a longer strap than all the other seats we have used which makes it easier to get her buckled in and it is comfortably situated so that she has room to grow. I can release the chest buckle and the lap buckle single handed - this feature is a definite PLUS. The only feature that is missing on this seat is a second cup holder but the two side pockets (under the arm rests) almost make up for that.  She is quite tall for her age and I like the extendable head rest so that the seat can grow with her.  It will be quite a long time before we will be forced to convert to backless booster."

I’m so glad I went with it! The pictures do not do it justice, we bought two, one for our 1 year old who is still rear facing and 1 for our soon to be 5 year old who is now forward facing.

That said I want to warn every time you clean your seat check the foam in head rest both mine and a cpst's friend both have come undone.

0,3,0,0,0,,I bought this at Walmart for $119. It's pretty good. Solid construction and easy to get in and out of the car. But the ratchet dials for tightening the straps is hard to use. On the door side the ratchet is too close to the seat and I can't get a grip on it to turn it without rubbing my hand against the seat and that hurts after a few turns. The dial on the other side is easier to reach but I have to reach all the way across the seat from the other side to turn it. It's also hard to turn sometimes. If you have any kind of arthritis or issues with hand strength this may be difficult for you to use. When it works though it works good.

1,3,3,2,3,,"I have to admit that I wanted to love this car seat since we have the old Britax Marathon and loved it.  However, was disappointed to find out that the bottom seat belt strap (the one that comes up from the bottom and goes in between my daughter's legs) was too short.  It's much shorter than on the other two Britax ClickTight car seats and the hard plastic pieces dig into my daughter's inner thighs and hurt her.  Even with the cushion that comes with the car seat. Since it's so short, it also makes it difficult for me to put on and take off the seat belts.  I tried to use this for a week but do not think it will work for us. I am returning it and getting the Advocate instead since that bottom strap is longer.  I went and compared them at Buy Buy Baby. Love everything else about the car seat but I just don't understand why that bottom strap is so short and you can't even extend it."

3,5,0,0,3,Fits 3 Across,"With four kids close in age, I knew we needed to get some of these for our van. previously using Graco extend2fit, no problems, but they take up more room of course. Awesome, comfortable, great colors. I debated on getting the ones with the headrests. But for example, the extend2fits have headrests and at least when ff their heads would still dangle down if they fell asleep. My kids have slept ff in this seat many times and as long as properly buckled they're okay and don't seem put off by not having headrests. So I have two of these in the 3rd row of a Toyota sienna 2005, along with a Chicco myfit harness and booster for my almost 5yo, all fit great with each other. For reference, my 4.5y has a sitting height (shoulder to floor) of about 15in, he would still fit in this seat but probably not for long. 3y has a sitting height of about 14in, she still has some inches left before outgrowing this seat.

0,3,0,0,5,,"I did a ton of research before buying this seat and am really regretting the decision.  I have no idea how this seat has such a high review unless our family just has really bad luck.  Either we happen to have two defective units or two cars that don't work well at all with this seat.  These were installed rear facing in a 2004 Jeep Liberty and a 2003 Honda Accord.  Here are the issues we have:<br /><br />-Installation was a nightmare - I can't understand how people say how easy it is.  There are two straps to tighten - one on each side. The first strap (you pull them sequentially) does not tighten at all if it is clipped to the latch connector.  When you go to tighten the 2nd strap, it pulls all the way and is still too loose. We finally got it tight enough by pre-tightening strap 1, turning the seat sideways and having someone lean on it and then clicking the latch buckle in.  This made it tight enough to pull strap 2 enough to minimize movement, but required 2 people and was a major pain.<br /><br />-Positions are somewhat a gimmick.  We thought it would be great to be able to let our son sit up or lay down.  No such luck.  In the accord, only one setting falls within the bubble level.  In the Jeep, only 2 settings are accessible.<br /><br />-The tighten/release strap and button are jammed up against the seat.  We have to leave the seat fully reclined to be able to access the release button for the straps.  My wife complains because she has to stick her hand between the seat and carseat to release the strap every day.<br /><br />-The buckles are a pain.  They always get caught under my son and catch on his clothing.  Somehow the buckles get flipped every couple of days, but are a pain to flip back around.  My wife works in some pretty sketchy areas and is terrified by the amount of time it takes to get our son in and out of the seat.<br /><br />I don't know if we have two defective carseats, or if we have two incompatible cars, but these seats have been nothing but trouble.  I wish I would've read about these problems before hand and saved them money.<br /><br />Update 03/2015:<br /><br />We had bought these in advance and it was too late to return them by the time we installed.  We've been using them now for months and none of the issues have gotten any better - some have gotten worse:<br /><br />-Tightening - We have to brace ourselves on the door frame of the car and pull as hard as possible.  There is a loud screeching sound when we tighten them.  This is from two different seats bought from different retailers.  I tried tightening before doing the middle clip as some suggested and noticed no difference.<br />-Installation - We've had to take them out and put them back in a few times now.  Same problem - strap 1 cannot be tightened enough.  Strap 2 maxes out and the seat is still loose.  We're still having to pre-tighten strap 1 and use 2 people to get it tight enough.  More people have tried thinking we were crazy and all have had the same problem.<br />-Recline - still not usable.  Like I said, this was one of the factors that made me choose this seat, but it cannot be used.<br />-Clips flipping - still a problem.  About 1 in 10 times pulling my son out of the seat flips the clips.  They flip backwards easily, but are a pain to flip back.  It's a ton of fun when this happens when it's storming outside.  Leave it flipped you say?  Nope - no chance of tightening with it flipped!<br />-Support - Support was non-existent.  They required all sorts of documentation (thanks for making me uninstall the seats for the serial number!) to even talk to me and were no help.<br /><br />Right now I'm hoping forward facing is better - I feel terrible being tempted to flip to forward facing and decrease safety to make our carseat usable.<br /><br />Update 10/15:<br /><br />We've now turned the seats forward facing.  You can tell that they were designed for this and that rear facing was added in hindsight.  Strap management is still a pain - if I forget to prep the seat in advance (completely loosen the straps and hang them over the sides) they get caught under my son.  Trying to fish them out has about a 50% chance of flipping the clip backwards.  Flipping it back takes forever - especially with a restless toddler squirming.  We no longer have tightening issues, and the tightening strap is no longer jammed up against the seat.<br /><br />If this were only sold as a forward facing seat, I would rate it a 3.  Because it is advertised as convertible, I maintain my one star review.  There were just too many safety concerns to be worth it.  Find something else that will tighten to the car and child tightly enough.  There are a ton of reviews that mention the tightening problem, but Chicco doesn't want to acknowledge it."
1,4,1,1,0,,"We got this to use only on vacations. It is not that easy to route the buckle in and out of the belt path. My daughter complained about it being uncomfortable on her bottom. The seat slid up towards the back a few times, but that didn’t hurt the way the belt fit on her lap. I would not use this as an everyday seat, but it is good for travel when luggage on a plane can be an issue."

1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel","This worked fairly well for a recent trip. We tested it out a bit before we went and quickly realized that it will slide around on cloth seats (as others had mentioned in their reviews). I took a piece of that non-slip rubberized cloth often used for lining kitchen drawers and cabinets, etc., and it helped a bit. This seat is much smaller than a conventional booster seat, but still not really small. My personal item for carrying on-board flights is a great, small Rick Stevens knapsack (sadly, appears to have been discontinued! :-( ), and this booster mostly fills that up. At times, the shoulder strap holding strap gets out of position, basically getting in my son's armpit or behind his head. But. all in all, we felt safer and were able to avoid the highway robbery of renting from the car rental agency (basically, the same cost as this seat!)."

3,5,0,0,3,Fits 3 Across,"I got this for my 16 month old after deciding we wanted smaller car seats for my Chevy Malibu. Installation with LATCH was impossible as we couldn’t find an angle to tighten the seat down, so we went with the seatbelt installation. While I sat in the seat, my husband tightened it down. It doesn’t move at all on the belt path + feels very secure. It came with 2 infant inserts, a buckle cover + 2 sleeve-like covers for the shoulder pieces. We couldn’t use the inserts due to the age of our son but they felt comfortable. I ended up removing the buckle cover because it kept getting in the way of me buckling my son. It’s a good idea, but poorly executed. The shoulder belt covers are amazing. They stop the belts from rubbing on my little one’s neck + also make pinching him with the belt clip impossible. The seat itself has a memory foam pad for underneath my baby’s butt + it is so cushy! He normally cries right away with other car seats but he seemed more comfortable in this one. My only issue is how far forward my seat has to go for it to not be leaning against the car seat. I’m 5’8 + I’m sitting up uncomfortably STRAIGHT to drive now…. But at least my little one is happier, comfortable + safe."

1,7,0,0,2,Car seat and suitcase sold separately,"Unless you have a very sturdy carry-on (and I mean VERY sturdy), this item will ruin your luggage.<br />The idea is good, but car seats with kids on them tend to be quite heavy, and our 80$ samsonite carry-on was almost ruined after using this for a couple of hours. The wheels buckled outwards because of the weight added, and even after unstrapping them, it wouldn't run as smooth anymore. I guess luggage are designed to withstand a certain load in them, and adding that much unbalanced weight can make them fail, which is what ended up happening.<br />It is also expensive for what it is. You can mimic the same behaviour by just getting a ring, and strapping the car seat hooks on it (2 sides, and top hooks used to lock the car seat in position in the car).<br />I give it 2 stars for the idea. It might work to just move your car seat around and not have to carry it, but definitely not with a toddler in it (my daughter was only 1 when we tried this)."
2,7,0,0,3,Washable FabricRemovable Seat Cushion,"After spending countless hours researching convertible car seats we chose this one for our 11 month old.

He has a long,thin build and seems very happy and comfortable now in this new seat. I believe it's because this seat sits up higher(so he can see more) and is wider/more roomy. The safety ratings for this seat are why we purchased it after reviewing Peg Perego convertible, Recaro, Diono and other Britax models. While Diono is also a very safe seat, its much taller back may not have fit as well in rear facing position in our car. The installation was not hard at all and if you go to Britax web sight you can watch videos to help make sure you are doing it correctly.

My son uses this seat primarily as my daughter has her own seat for the car. He has never complained about comfort and it seems to be rather secure in the car.<br /><br />It's easy to clean as you can remove the fabric when there is the eventual spill from the kids eating in the backseat.

They arrived brand new, and it was easy to see that they hadn't been returned previously or anything.

I currently have two other Graco car seats for them (will be moving those to dad's car in order to ditch our cheaper Safety1st seats that we don't like at all!) that we like just fine, but love the improvements of these newer models.<br />When I bought them they were on sale for $186 each from Amazon, which was a fantastic deal!<br />We are really happy with them!!"

I find it to be pretty bulky, especially compared to my Clek seat and because of the bulk, it seems a little less than ideal for older kids.  The biggest downside to me is the 40"" rear facing limit.  My 3 year old is not particularly tall and is already bumping up against that limit, so I think a lot of kids will size out height-wise well before they get to even 4 which is disappointing."

2,4,0,0,1,,My only complaint is with the car seat installed you can’t move the front seat back very far. It is bulky (maybe they all are idk this is the only one I’ve had) but when the price is right and everything else is great you make do. Highly recommend!
0,5,0,0,5,,This is a great car seat which I bought for my granddaughters. Very happy with it.
0,4,0,0,5,,"Long post alert as I felt like posting some useful installation steps for front facing seating position as it is missing in manual.<br /><br />First of all, the seat looks comfortable and secure. Good padding everywhere which ensures kid’s protection. Amazon delivery was quick and efficient as always. Now I will move on to the tricky part of the installation and will add some pics for other people benefits. Feel free to click the “Helpful” button so that others may also benefit from these steps missing in the crappy manual.<br /><br />Now you will notice that there are 2 lower anchors straps present at bottom of seat which will come hooked in rear facing position out of the box. One has to move these anchor straps to front facing seating which is tricky. To do this, first press the buttons on the anchor hooks and slide both of them out. Then open the cushion at bottom section by opening the hooks and buttons inside. Pull out both anchor hooks from either sides and hold it against the red rod inside. Slide it up the red rod to the label where it says “Forward facing anchor strap here”. After you have done this, pull the anchor hooks out from either side of marked section. Refer images for additional info. Do ensure that this belt is straight and not crumbled up inside. Put the seat cover and padding back in original place. After you have completed these steps, the booster is ready to be anchored. In case you are not aware where to anchor these hooks in your car seat, check your car manual or just search online to find the exact location. Hook the anchors up in desired position and pull the tab by pressing the button to tighten and secure. This strap should not be loose in any case. Once you have tightened it properly, you will realize that the booster seat is firmly secured and will not slide. Finally anchor the tethered belt located at back of the booster to rear car anchor. Each car will have the anchor hooks placed at different location, so check car manual or search online again. In my CRV, this anchor hook was present in car trunk top side hidden by a cover.<br /><br />Once you have successfully completed the steps to anchor the hooks in all three positions, adjust the position of the harness buckle. There are 3 levels to pass the harness buckle so ensure that the harness buckle at bottom passes through the same position in cushion as it is inside for maximum comfortable sitting of your child. You will notice that if the harness buckle passes through position 2 inside but then passes from position 3 in the cushion, the cushion or padding crumbles up. Adjust the booster height as desired and check whether the level indicator on left side of booster is in blue region. All set and you are good to go. Thanks for reading till end of this long post and I wish you and your family a happy and safe driving experience."

0,7,0,2,3,,Love these seats. We have two and my only complaint is that it's hard to tighten with the kid is forward facing. Maybe it is the same on other brands but it is pretty tough to get these snug. Whenever I take the kids out of the car when someone else like Grandma or Grandpa put them in the straps are loose even though they swear they tighten them. I find if I pull out on the chest strap to take in the slack around the legs and then pull up on tensioning strap with two hands I can get it snug. It just doesn't seem to go as easy as it should. When the kid is rear facing you can reach behind the seat easily to take in the slack and then tighten the tensioning strap with the other hand.

From research there is no fire retardant chemical applied (if worried about SIDS). The head protection doesn't limit his view around him. I also was looking at Graco seats, and after having the one for his infant seat he did not enjoy being in the seat, and was always soaking in sweat, this was a major concern of mine. Peg Pergo car seat has made taveling so much easier and creates more room in the vehicle. It was expensive but, I don't need another one until a booster seat is needed. I only gave 4 stars because of the seat angle in my vehicle when buckled in, I placed a blanket to adjust becacuse of how my back seat is for rear facing. There is no level bubble just a line to make sure seat is at the right leveling, not a big deal to me."
1,4,1,2,2,Cup Holder,"cushion is a bit slim, but my kids don't mind at all. super lightweight. durable (taken on a few flights without any damage).<br /><br />cupholders on the side are a nice touch. they are a bit hard for the kids to pull out though.<br /><br />detachable cover for washing.<br /><br />strongly recommend these boosters if you want a lightweight option. along these lines though the big uprights are better cushion and protection perhaps, but when they get to 5+ years old, they start wanting to go on playdates and riding other parent's cars. these have been a godsend in taking in/out of cars frequently. the seatbelt aligns very well into these and my kids can buckle themselves now. Besides the biggest factor for safety is how safely you drive and how big your car is in comparison to the other assuming everyone is buckled in.<br /><br />Note as well on the rare occasion my kids fall asleep in the car they do flop around more in these than the uprights as there isn't a side for them to lean against. I just deal with it as they don't do it often but if you road trip a lot maybe something to consider."

My son is a real busy body and hates strollers, so I worried that he would not want to sit in it during our layover after being stuck in a plane for 4 hours, but he loved it.

I have arthritis in my shoulders and back, and have had both hips replaced due to arthritis.  We started out with the Doona car seat/stroller which made getting the child in and out of the car easy.  However as he got past age one, the weight became an issue for me.  I switched to a regular car seat.  Within a few weeks of twisting to get him in and out of the seat, I was in agony everyday so I splurged on this seat.  It has been a godsend.  It fits into my Subaru Ascent as well as the Doona did.  The seat is just at the right height for me to buckle the toddler in and he has no way to avoid me.  I wish I had one of these for my other grandchildren.  My daughter easily installed it after watching a video.  My grandson appears to be as comfortable as in his earlier seats.  My sole complaint is that the strap which goes between his legs should be longer.  Everytime I place him in the seat, the buckle/strap is under his rear end and I have to lift him to pull it out.  I am not sure what will happen as he gets bigger as I do not want the strap to cut him in a sensitive spot."

1,5,1,2,3,,"Its solid, nice looking. But its extremely firm, especially back. The back is like a board covered with only 1 layer of fabric. My daughter refused to seat on it even 10 min. I put some foam rubber between plastic back and the fabric to mitigate this. Probably different styles-colors differ in terms of comfort as i can not believe that Our chair can have 4.8 comfort score. Our color is red and without any extra foam rubber its too firm.<br /><br />I kept this chair as this is the only chair that does not require to remove headrests in the car to install it. Its a huge advantage for me. I can not remove headrests in my car therefore the options are limited.<br /><br />The chair is very big that is good. but in my car its hard to fasten a seatbelt as the chair hardly fits in the space. My child used to fasten the belt herself in previous chair but with this one its hardly  impossible. Also we can not use a cup holder due to the same space limitation.

1,4,1,0,3,,"I'm confounded by the number of 5 stars this car seat received. Did y'all buy a different seat than I did? I spent an hour trying to install the car seat before finally giving up. I couldn't get the LATCH on the Nautilus to, well, latch properly. The problem is that I just can't seem to tighten the strap so that the seat is installed correctly and won't move during transit.  It's a similar problem that I've had with other Graco seats.  There is no way that my kids are using this death trap. This Nautilus is going back as soon as humanly possible so that I can purchase the Britax Frontier instead. I know that the Britax will latch properly within minutes. The most I have ever spent trying to install a Britax seat is five minutes--and that's if I'm having a hard time with it. An hour is way too long--especially considering that I will be removing the seat often so that the grandparents can take the kids in their car."

0,5,0,2,3,,"Overall, it's a good seat. I wouldn't recommend against it, however, there are a few shortcomings that I don't love. We purchased this as a second car seat for my husband's car. I have a Ch**** Next*** brand car seat in my car. So, it was interesting to compare the two. Our daughter is 1, and we are converting her from an infant carrier to a car seat, so we still plan to have her rear facing.<br /><br />Things I don't love about this seat:<br />- It's hard to install. We used the anchor clips. First of all, the default position for the seat out of the box is front facing, so there's a little bit of up front work to move them to the rear facing position. My husband has a '16 Acura MDX. I'm not sure if it's the way the seats are positioned or what, but neither he nor I could get the seat tight enough. The Ch**** seat in my car is incredibly easy to tighten - I can do it by myself (I have a '15 RDX). This seat was a completely different story. I read online that you can purchase swimming pool noodles, cut them down to carseat width, and use them as a wedge between the carseat and the seat. We ended up needing to wedge about 3 pieces of the noodle in there before it actually fit securely and didn't move more than in inch from side to side. But, we did end up getting it tight.<br />- The shoulder strap pads are too small. The strap pinches my daughters neck, so we had to buy additional strap pads. Not a huge deal, but just seemed like something I shouldn't have to worry about.<br />- The cup holders are huge, and make it a little tricky to lift the child into the seat when it's rear facing.<br /><br />Things I like about this seat:<br />- It is easier to tighten the straps on the child than the Ch**** car seat.<br />- The seat pads are very cushy and soft.<br />- It has cool little pouches to hold the buckles out of the way when you put the child in the seat. This way, you're not constantly having to pull the buckles out from under the child each time you place them into the seat.<br />- The cover is relatively easy to remove. I figured this out when I had to move the anchor straps to the rear facing position.<br />- The shoulder straps are easy to move up and down.<br /><br />I gave this 4 starts because it's over $100 less that the Ch**** carseat that I have in my car, and overall has more pros than cons. However, if you need a carseat that's easy to move from car to car, this might not be it. If this is going to stay in 1 car, I would say it's worth it."
0,4,0,1,0,,"So overall I definitely would recommend this card seat!<br /><br />Installation: it’s quite a large seat and not exactly lightweight. I installed first using the seatbelt and then I used the car hooks. I felt more secure with the hooks but that’s really just a personal choice and you have the option for both. Because this seat does require tightening of the belts I did have to enlist my husbands help to get it tightened. We’ve used the britax click tight before and that one does all the tightening for you (which is nice) however I feel this one is more padded. Overall took about 10 minutes to install.<br /><br />Safety: this seat feels very padded and secure. I like that it sits your child up much higher than other car seats we’ve tried. Since it sits up high enough for our daughter to see out the window I feel it has helped with her motion sickness. It also has the slide to unlock harness which is great since we’ve recently started dealing with children unbuckling themselves. They can no longer do that with this seat.<br /><br />Converting: This is super easy to adjust the height of, just squeeze the handle and pull up, which is similar to the way britax works. I think it’s going to be very easy to transition this with our kids growth.<br /><br />Cleaning: So far it wipes clean very easily and I haven’t had to take it apart to wash the pads yet but it doesn’t seem like it will be too difficult.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful please vote accordingly."

3,5,0,0,3,Fits 3 Across,"Received this item and spent tons of time getting all the strap placement correct. Went to install it rear-facing using the latch straps only to find that one of the latch buckles was sewn on backwards. It was impossible to latch it safely. Attaching it the correct way (like a stapler) would cause the loose strap used to tighten the latch strap down to be underneath rather than on top. This rendered it impossible to tighten the strap to a safe tension. If you wanted to make it to where the loose end was on top so you could actually tighten it, the latch would have to be buckled upside-down and the strap would be twisted (huge no-no). I sent it back and exchanged it for the same brand and model car seat we have already been using. I was just too displeased with the quality control check off that was missed on this particular seat. It makes me nervous about what else may have been missed before it left the factory."

0,3,0,0,5,,"This Baby Jogger car seat is the first car seat of this brand that I have reviewed.  It is a substantial seat that reminds me a bit of the Chicco, Maxi Cosi, and Britax seats I have used in the past.<br /><br />This is the first seat that I have used where the seat can swivel a rear facing child toward the door for easier loading and unloading.  I find this feature to be intriguing, but I also suspect that if a recall were to happen on this seat in the future, my best guess would be that this novelty feature will probably be the problem.  I see potential for the seat to not fully lock into the rear facing position after being swiveled.<br /><br />The seat is generously padded and the head rest of the seat is easy to adjust.  The shoulder pads on the harness have a grippy material on the interior and the back side of the pads.  I don't like the textured material on the back of the seat pads because I see it as an issue during the summer months where a child may be wearing a tank top or sundress.  I wouldn't want the grippy material on my baby's skin on a hot day.  It is probably the feature that I like the least on this car seat.<br /><br />Installation for this seat is pretty easy.  For the rear facing seat, there is a built in lock off in the base of the seat that allows you to get a secure installation.  For forward facing installation, I find it is best if you fully extend the head rest so you have ample room to maneuver the seat belt or LATCH belt through the pathway.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice seat.  It seems to be very good quality and attention to detail is evident in the design."

We also now use it every day, as our kids are older and don't need more than a booster.<br /><br />A few years ago, we spend several months researching portable booster seats for travel, with a lot of confusing reviews and advice.

0,4,0,0,5,,"We've been through so many car seats as a frequently flying family.  Living overseas on a temporary assignment has us constantly in the air, and so few seats have tolerated the constant switching of cars, getting tossed into airplanes and onto baggage carousels.<br /><br />We had a Britax literally disassemble itself after about a year - we found a screw under our floor mat that we traced back to the frame assembly of the seat.  Another version Graco still works and is our back-up seat, though like our Maxi-Cosi is very difficult to pull the strap on.<br /><br />This seat has withstood all of the torture, is perfectly narrow (yet still just as supportive) to fit through the aisle of an airplane - even the regional ones - and the straps are still easy to adjust.  Other things to note:<br />- The seat is still light weight and easy to move and very easy to install<br />- The anchor system stows nicely and out of the way and doesn't get caught on baggage carousels<br />- The shoulder pads a a little on the thin side, but they stay in place and don't affect our son. This would be my only complaint<br />- Living in the desert of the GCC, in the summer months the seat doesn't get burning hot, compared to another Graco seat where the label can be searing.<br /><br />This is our fifth and last car seat we will need to buy!"

I personally wait to transition to this till the kids are almost out of being required to be in car seats, and they enjoy the cup holders, elevated seating to see out the window, independence of buckling themselves in (with assistance usually), and headrest for leaning during naps.  Changing cars? Undo belt buckle and move. Too tall? Remove the back and just use the booster bottom itself."

4,7,0,0,3,,"(I'm Roger's partner- the mamma, really.)<br /><br />While this seat is clearly safe, and I love the microfiber fabric better than the plasticky alternatives, I'm not real thrilled with this seat.<br /><br />I've had the same problem as others with moving the handle back and forth. One side works okay, but the other side is tricky. Here's how we make it work: first, take a deep breath. Then grab the handle/button and squeeze hard without putting any pressure on the handle to move it ANY OTHER direction. AFTER you have depressed the button, THEN you can try to move the handle. The handle has to be perfectly centered before the button will be depressible and the handle therefor movable. Not an easy task if you've got a screaming baby to attend to (and taking them out with the handle up is pretty awkward-- its very easy to bump babe's head). If you look at the mechanism you can see why it doesn't work very well.<br /><br />The triangular handle seemed great, but the seat is still very awkward to carry. I'm probably on the weak side in terms of mothers, but even my 8.5lb newborn made this thing tough to carry. I dread carrying him around at 18lbs. Its too heavy to carry away from my body, so I end up having it banging against my leg while I awkwardly hobble around. Or I hold it sideways in front of me with two hands. However, I must admit, I haven't tried to lift other seats.<br /><br />Everything else works fine, and I'm sure glad its easy to adjust. The crotch buckle is annoying though in that it takes two hands to hold the two sides together before it can get inserted into the between-the-legs strap. Maybe that's typical, but I'd rather not have to do it that way."

1,4,4,2,3,Adjustable,Why did I wait so long to buy this? I don't know. We previously bought the Brica car seat dolly. It was garbage. We have a Britax clicktight marathon. The seat attaches much better to this dolly than the Brica one. This dolly is also so much sturdier. I can actually put my son in his seat on the dolly and wheel him unlike the Brica dolly. I finally decided to buy this one after a near disastrous airport trip with my 3 year old son by myself. The Brica dolly was so terrible about every 50 feet I was having to stop and stabilize it.  I could not put my son in the seat with that dolly as it was too unstable. I had my son sitting on top of our luggage on a luggage cart. We were walking to the curb waiting to be picked up from the airport and the Brica dolly tipped and I let go of the baggage cart with my son on it (my mistake) to upright the Brica dolly. The baggage cart almost rolled into the street. Someone else had to catch it for me. The Brica dolly went in the trash and I promptly got on amazon to have this dolly shipped to me on vacation for our return airport trip. So much better. So much better.<br /><br />Update 2/9/18: after another airport trip with this dolly I am more in love with it than I thought. If you have a Britax clicktight car seat this dolly is wonderful. It attaches to the dolly as firmly as in the car. When we put the seat on the dolly my son can ride in it no problem. My husband jokes that it is almost as good as traveling without a kid as it feels like just a carry on bag being wheeled around the airport. We fold it up at the gate and put it in the seat part of the car seat when we put it in our bag and gate check the car seat. It’s far better than any other car seat dolly I’ve tried.

0,2,1,0,1,,"We bought this car seat from a different source after finding a better sale price, but thought I would share my thoughts here.<br /><br />Great, quality car seat that I felt met my high safety expectations, after a different high-end brand let me down (having had recalls regarding their China-made plastic and removal of their anti-rebound bar design in the new bases). I read many safety websites and comparisons regarding this car seat and other competitors', but seeing the actual results of the crash safety tests and the amount of G-Force transferred to the baby (this car seat rated among the best for dispersal of G-Force and impact energy) I felt happy going with it. The fabric looks like it will breath well and I'm impressed by the different inserts and quality of construction. The base is also narrower so it has a better fit if you want to try doing the three-across car seat setup in your truck or car. My husband loves that the seatbelt lockoff is a big panel that easily pushes down instead of those flimsy narrow lockoffs you see on other car seats. I love the European belt routing if you're installing without the base. Honestly, it's everything I've come to expect from a modern car seat.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The shoulder pads - someone else mentioned that the velcro is sewn on the inside where the fabric meets the harness belts, and it is still this way with the one we purchased. It catches on EVERYTHING, including the harness belts themselves at times. We tried different dolls and stuffed animals in the car seat for fun, my children enjoy it, but I have to be careful they don't get caught by this velcro. I can foresee issues with this and will probably remove them and use a different brand or something. They are great material other than this one design flaw.<br /><br />The canopy - it's a great UPF protected canopy made of breathable fabric, again quality materials. but it CLICKS loudly into place once fully extended, and I can see this startling a baby. Also, as many others have mentioned, the clearance for your hands is barely there while trying to carry. Honestly, I bought the car seat anyway knowing this and having seen it in many videos. I am not bothered by it as much because the car seat is so light and easy to handle that I don't need to do too much &#34;manhandling.&#34; I'm sure my husband might disagree with his bigger hands, but we will see.<br /><br />I'm happy I went with it, and look forward to lots of road trips! The car seat should last past baby's first year!"

2,3,0,0,2,,"A great seat for the price.  Not horribly easy to install, but manageable with some patience. Seems comfy enough for my 11 month-old grandson.  We don't plan to take any long trips with him, so it's fine for occasional use, as it advertises.  I would have loved for some way to attach some diversionary toys to it, but there are none, so when he tosses a toy out of the seat, it's gone. I'll probably figure out some way to clip a strap on to hold toys.  I don't care about the cup holder (someone mentioned it) because I don't plan for him, at least not at this age, to be drinking anything he could choke on - not on my watch.  The strap for the headrest runs side to side and the slot is up and down, so the headrest is tilted a little, but that's minor.  We took our first little jaunt with him a few days ago, and he fell asleep. Make sure the arrows are perpendicular to the floor for the right tilt so their head doesn't fall forward.  Also, I do recommend getting some of those fuzzy guards for the straps that go beside the neck because the edges of the straps will rub on their tender skin and leave a mark/sore place.  I'm tickled that we can now take him on little outings, and I think the price was very reasonable for such a high safety rated convertible car seat."

1,5,1,0,0,,"I really liked this Britax Highpoint high-back & backless booster car seat and ordered it for my newest grandchild. We now have 10 granddaughters and 2 grandson's and want to keep them safe. What attracted me was this tallest head protection as the newest grandson will most likely be very tall. This booster seat is for children 40-120 lbs. which is nice to have that range. But the best part is the 3 layers of protection which is (1) head restraint that will go up or down into 10 different positions in dark gray (2) back and built-up sides like a wing-back chair that will protect your child from impact by keeping their head within the chair (3) extra dark gray side plastic padding for further impact protection. The RED areas are for the seat belt guides with padding in the center. Easy to attach seat-belt. And 2 dishwasher-safe removable cup holders which is great for sippy cups, bottled water, and snacks. You can also take the back off and just use the bottom when your little one is no longer little, The booster seat will raise them up in order to see everything outside the windows but keeps them safe with the seat belt and shoulder strap. I believe all these different levels of head restraint features validate safety for my new grandson, and your child too."

4,4,1,2,0,Cup Holder,"We purchased this booster for my 4 year old daughter who was becoming too tall for her 5-point harness-style car seat to fit appropriately and safely.  The back is high enough to allow for napping in the car, which was an important consideration for me.  She loves having the slide out cup-holders, although they are not deep enough to prevent cups on the tall and skinny side from tumbling out (as I learned the hard way).<br /><br />Although this is true of nearly all booster seat on the market, I love the convenience of not having to wrestle with the latch system every time I want to have an adult passenger in the back seat.  The colors are nice, and my daughter loves her big girl seat.  We have since bought several more of the same brand for other cars in which she rides (grandparents and such).  My only slight quibble is the fact that the arm rest covers come off very easily, which means that I have to put them back on nearly every time I strap her in.  A slight annoyance, but for the safety rating, quality, and price, you just can't go wrong with this seat.  I would definitely recommend for anyone looking to purchase a high-backed booster for a transitioning toddler."

She loves her purple ""big kid"" seat and reports it is very comfortable.  It is easy to latch into our CRV and weighs very little compared to her behemoth infant seat.<br /><br />I would note, though, that one may be limited as to which back seat to place the booster in certain SUVs because it may block part of the driver's view (our daughter's seat has to be place directly behind the driver's seat to keep all sightlines clear).<br /><br />Great product.

It was the biggest reason why we wanted this car seat, to rear face longer.<br />Unfortunately, my child is in the 100th percentile for height and, at 8 months, his feet are touching the seat of the car so he'll probably need forward facing before he's even a year old.<br />Great carseat otherwise but I'm glad this was gifted to us instead of paying out of pocket for a feature that doesn't work for us.

2,5,0,2,2,,"I'd like to chip in my two cents about the harness, especially. It is very difficult to tighten. My wife always asks me to help her get it tight enough and, now that I have a broken rib, it is very hard for me to securely tighten it, too. This is just so unnecessary. For a seat this expensive, you'd expect it to be fairly easy to tighten. Also, loosening again is very hard, requiring two hands, which is difficult when you're the only one taking your child out of the seat or putting him/her back in again. I have some buyer's remorse, and I'm mulling returning this and using the Nuna Pipa infant car seat until our baby grows out of it, then perhaps trying Nuna's more expensive convertible car seat, given our relative success with their products so far.<br /><br />As for install, this thing goes in such that it is pretty easy to torque it when trying to tighten the harness, so you can easily end up with a crooked seat, which makes me nervous. I'm inclined to switch to the LATCH installation instead, but given our issues with the harness, we may just send the whole thing back.<br /><br />Otherwise it's fine. Relatively easy to adjust height and recline (though not great on the recline, actually). LO seems comfortable in it. We used it for a trip from Boston to New York, and he was less fussy than he was the time we went down with him in the Pipa carrier, but it's impossible to know if it was all due to the seat itself."

With my little one I have way more anxiety than I ever had when my oldest was little. So I need quality. I’ve been a graco fan for years and still am. It was hard for me to sway. I went to reviews which is something I actually rarely do since I want to form my own opinion. But with two other kids between my husband and I and needing two seats (because no mom wants to constantly take them in and out) we needed something more budget friendly. I love the material on the seats. Like a scuba wet suit in comparison versus that scratchy material on many. It’s easy to tighten the straps. Has awesome cushion around her head. And it’s fairly easy to install if your seatbelt will cooperate and not lock (rear position. I have a tiny child). These were my first product purchases by this company and I will say I’m impressed. So if you’re looking for top quality without busting the budget and a safe design, give it a shot."

If your a neat freak, don't buy this color by the way.  (Green seat)  It does not was well.  We do not eat in our cars, dirt/sand from shoes or shorts caused dingy look that washing did not help.  I wash on gentle cycle, air dry.  Three washes, dulled color on cold wash. Three stars for this due to seat material quality.<br />Now I'm actually needing to use the seat more these day's and he's taller requiring me to buy another.  Buy strictly from Amazon is my suggestion!"

We hoped it would be worth the money- it’s not. We got it for our 12m old as the description said it would fit her. She slides from one side to the other in it and it leaves significant red marks on her neck when she’s been in it. She can also slip her arms out because the shoulder straps are so huge. We thought it might be user error for a while or that she might grow into it, so we kept looking into it, and missed the return window. When I reached out to the company in hopes that they’d back their product, they refused to refund us. I highly recommend not purchasing this seat!"

0,4,0,0,0,,"My wife and I really like this car seat. We purchased this car seat after our daughter out grew her Infant car seat (Graco Click Connect 35). We use it on our Dodge Durango and have it placed behind the passenger seat in the rear facing position. We like how easy it was to install, just install the base and then attach the car seat to the base. We also liked how easy it is to change from rear to forward position and how the seat grows with my child. The padding is great, and the buckle is firmly secured. I have to push it at least twice with my thumb to unbuckle it, so im sure that my daughter wont be able to remove it on her own. It has an indicator on the side of the seat that tells you when its level (in the rear facing positon) and it ends up being in a recline position however, my daughter does not mind it. It does take up a lot of space in the rear facing position, thats why we have it installed behind the passenger seat so the driver can be comfortable but once turned around to the forward facing position we will recover some of that space. If you drive a smaller car then this seat might be an issue as far as space.  It is on the heavy side but, we have no need to be moving it from car to car so it works out for us. We are expecting our second baby and I placed out Infant car seat next to this one and it fits perfectly for my vehicle. It is a little pricey but in my situation it was a great investment, plus we wont have to purchase another seat since it grows with my child."
0,3,0,0,1,,It's much darker than the pictures. More of a reddish color<br /> The lap buckle is ridiculously hard to adjust. The anchor doesn't fit through the slot to move the bottom buckle farther out for an older baby. The length is also shorter than in my other carseats

0,3,0,0,1,,"I bought this as a travel car seat and a backup car seat for my husband's car. It was lightweight and narrow enough to fit on most airplane seats. As soon as I opened it, I regretted purchasing it. You obviously get what you pay for. It's cheap and flimsy looking and the seat cover is really thin and provides no real cushioning. Also the cup holder that came with it is a really stupid design that bunches up the seat cover. It also wasn't the cup holder pictured on the box or in the instruction manual. I wonder if it was even the right cupholder....? As a backup car seat, these issues alone are not deal breakers, but what made me return it was when we tried to install it rear-facing with a seat belt we could NOT get it tight enough. With two adults, we couldn't get this seat installed safely. It would slide several inches side to side and the worst part was it would tip forward into the seat back.<br /><br />Our main car seat is an Orbit Baby and with the base you can install it really securely. There is no budging once it's installed. We ended up buying the Diono Radian r120 and I was able to install it safely by myself. No sliding or tipping (because it has a rear-facing tether)!"

1,4,1,0,3,,"5 STARS is not enough to rate this one. I'm a mother of 2 girls under 4, so we had to buy 2 so they would match. :) We originally purchased Eddie Bauer car seats for our first daughter, and this one is by far WAAAY BETTER! These carseats are SUPERIOR in many ways: cushion, materials used, safety/comfort features. It has 3 reclining positions! The head rest grows with your child and wraps around enough for them to rest their head when they fall asleep. It fits like a cockpit, they look snug and feel much safer in these car seats. My oldest can't unbuckle the 5-point harness anymore! She loves the fact that the straps have cushiony wraps around them, and the buckle on the crotch has a protective cover for their groin area. Read the instruction manual, it's in plain language, with clear instructions and pictures, it even has a separate manual in spanish.  I can't believe what a good deal we got, we won't have to buy another car seat since it converts to a booster seat, safe for up to 100 lbs. I highly recommend this carseat!

1,4,1,0,3,,My son today said his privates hurt while sitting in this car seat. Like other reviewers said the bottom buckle is way too close to the baby - there should be 2 more slots to extend position. Would NEVER buy again.
0,3,3,0,3,,"You can not beat the clicktight install, it is so easy and a rock solid install every time. I think the main issue people have with this seat is they use the lower anchors which it wasn’t really designed for, they’re there solely because they have to be, it is designed for a seat belt install. It’s also important to know that you don’t pull the belt super tight and lock it and then try and close the panel, simply remove the slack and close the seat, it’s that easy. The fabric is soft and I absolutely love you can put it in the washer and dryer. It is just an easy to use, non complicated seat. I also love that it has the option to use the anti rebound bar. We have had other Britax seats, some Gracos and a safety first. We hated the safety first, the Gracos were nice but not as easy to install and I loathe the top tether on graco seats, it is so hard to loosen. We prefer the Britax seats for sure. I also like that they’re made in the US."

However, I really like the removable liner that you can throw into the washing machine. Baby has not arrived yet so I have not used it, but so far I am very happy with it."
1,4,1,1,0,,"Waste of money.  I bought this and tried it for my small 8 and 10 year olds who still use backless boosters.  Both kids found the hard front lip uncomfortable under their legs.  The lap belt fit was horrendous.  Way too low on their legs.  LEGS.  My kids are thinner so if you've got a really chunky kid, you might be fine.  It was also extremely dependent on the belt geometry of the specific car.  The red side belt guides need to be adjustable front to back, not just side to side.  Speaking of which, they kept sliding back in.  My kids have been asked to try many seats over the years and this was a fail for both kids in both cars.  Try the bubble bum or incognito or harmony boosters instead."

0,4,0,0,5,,I don’t understand how everyone else’s babies fit comfortably! The angle of the head rest pushes my little guys head so far forward. When sleeping there is always chin to chest positioning. He’s small (20lbs) and I’m already his legs are pushed pretty tight to the seat. This is in the rear facing position so perhaps it’s different when front-facing. I drive a Toyota Tacoma and it is a tiiiight fit.
0,4,0,0,5,,"Lives up to the name...Slim Fit! I have a Pontiac G6 and needed something not as wide as other car seats due to having a 3 year old and 5 year old. So now in the backseat I have a Graco Contender 65, a Chicco booster (no back) seats and this seat. I previously had a Chicco Keyfit 30 and it was pretty tight back there. Now there is actually a little room in between the seats. My son is able to kick his sister somehow back there, maybe because the bottom is more open and doesn’t keep them as separated... but that is my only issue that’s not too much of a concern to me. It seems very safe and comfortable and well made. I am very happy with the purchase!"

Its a bit heavy, as are all seats this size, but with a Travelmate it is super easy in and out of airports.

It turned out that my son was not ready for this car seat.  This car seat cannot use it rear facing.  This is only front facing and can be used for one year and older.  Now that my boy cannot fit in the infant seat and still cannot use this one, I have to buy another one till he is one.  The product itself is great, but for us it was a waste of money.<br /><br />If I have known, I should have bought 32 Graco infant seat that he could have used up to 32 lbs/32 inches (I'm sure that should be good till 1 year old), and then switched to this one."

But when my 40# 2yr old outgrew his Roundabout and was so heavy that picking himup to get him into the Marathon was a chore I started looking for a 65# harnessed alternative. ( We have the Recaro Young sport but it only harnesses to 40#) After much research and checking them out at the store I found this seat. It is wonderful and my son loves it. He can get in & out easily and loves the cup holder, which is far better than any cup holder on any seat I've used. The only thing that I wish they'd change is the front buckle doesn't have an attachment to keep it from falling back. So when he gets in the seat he is usually sitting on the buckle so I have to dig it out from under him. A minor inconvenience for such a good seat at such a great price."

It has a strap to install using the Latch system, but it can only be used up to 30 lb. The other way to install is to use the seatbelt in the clicktight system. However, as of right now Britax says that the clicktight system cannot be used with inflatable seat belts found in some Fords and Lincolns. I didn't do enough research, and now I have a $300 seat that I can't use. If it was still useable to me, I probably would have given 4 stars."

4,4,0,1,0,,"I just received this and have not put it in the car yet- I will add more later. tt seems like a nice booster seat and I like the latch system to hold it in the seat, that it can go to just the bottom seat later, and most importantly, it has good safetly ratings both highback and backless. I don't understand the lower stars from people on here because they couldn't find the cup holder. All you have to do is look on the bottom and you will see it and just take it off and insert it in the slot on the side- the manual says not to take it off once it's in place. There are some negative reviews that the back falls apart when transporting to other vehicles. I don't see how this is happening unless it isn't locked into place good to start with. It does take 10-15 minutes to line it up right to the bottom piece and lock it in and then raise the back upright- look at the manual to help you. It can recline some when you are carrying it but holding the back and the bottom should alleviate that. The snack tray is handy and is a little tight when shutting and opening back up but not too bad. The cup holder worked great for the large soft drink cup we tried. I'm used to our Britax Marathon for over 5 years now which is heavy, big, and nicely padded. So that being said, the padding on this seat seems ok/adequate but definitely could be more, especially in the bottom seat piece. I will comment later about comfort level when used in the car. This seat is definitely lighter. The latch straps look short but they fit with my car's latch system fine and after adjusting the straps on the front the seat is pretty snug. I think the complaints on here of the latch straps being too loose may be due to how latch systems vary from car to car. An updated review to come soon."

1,4,4,2,3,Adjustable,Five starts because it worked as described.<br /><br />Used this for a trip to Korea.  Total 4 different flights both long and short haul.  This thing made it easy to transport our 2y/o through the airport in her car seat without a stroller.  On some of the flights we gate checked the car seat and opted for a CARES harness on board (another great purchase) instead.<br /><br />It collapses easily.  It's all metal so the only caveat is careful holding it as you can damage or dent things if you accidentally hit it with this thing.<br /><br />Some people mentioned this broke on them but I had no issues.  Seemed quite solid and sturdy to me.  As I said this made it easy to roll our kid around airports and hotels (after arriving from the airport).  Served it's purpose well so I give it 5 stars.
1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel","This is an awesome thing!  We use it for taxis and uber cars around town,or for a ride with someone without an installed car seat.  Very portable and perfect for that purpose.  Will probably use it with travel as well once I decide not to use a car seat on the plane (this can't be used on a plane).<br /><br />Update: this was well made and lasted past the expiration date, so we will be buying another.  My 7 yo fits perfectly on it and likes riding on it, although it is not our primary booster seat.  We use it as above, and it is great to travel with. I have seen both my parents not use it appropriately though, so you do need to take a few minutes to make sure lap belt goes through red thingies on the side of the seat and that the shoulder clip part is adjusted appropriately."

1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel",We have been big fans of bubble bum seats for years - they are wonderfully convenient for travel or when the kids are riding in someone else’s car. They take up so little space that I can fit 2 bubble bums in a carry on size suitcase with my clothes and a kid’s clothes. We purchased our first seat more than 3 years ago and noticed it started deflating a bit during use recently. We contacted their customer service and they immediately sent a new insert to us free of charge even though it was such an old seat. They also followed up to ensure we received it and were able to install the insert correctly. Great product and customer service!!!
1,4,4,2,3,Adjustable,"When I got this, I felt like it was overpriced for the item.  Having used it, I am ready to retract that concern.  We compared this cart to a no-name heavy duty luggage cart.  The generic one - not designed for carrying a car seat - cost slightly more and the car seat didn't fit.  We have only used it with a Cosco Scenera Next for airplane travel, but it worked great.  It's not an absolutely perfect fit - I had to get it balanced carefully before tightening the straps.  But once I did that, it was stable.  We didn't put our daughter in it, but instead piled our backpacks and diaper bag into it.<br /><br />This item rolls smoothly and is quite sturdy.  The only thing I'd change is that it tends to come &#34;unfolded&#34; too easily.  A length of velcro solved that problem, but a better clip would have been nice."

Now we are use to it and I’m confident she can buckle herself. I use a thin foam pad under it to expand the comfort but it is safe as we were run off the road recently and hitting the breaks hard on a highway was scary but she had zero marks. *NOTE my 4 year old is tall for her age she is 46 inches tall and weighs 42lbs

Although the bottoms where they sit are smaller, the upper part of the carseat defeats any benefits you get from the bottom as it's wider than even most regular carseats we have.

1,4,1,0,3,,"I have owned two of the Graco Nautilus' as well as a few random seats (my child goes between 5 cars and it's easier to just have one in every car). I was involved in a rear-end collision at 35 MPH (the woman was talking on her phone) a while back while my child was in the car, even though it was my car that was hit, she was uninjured. I purchased a new Nautilus and about a year later was rear-ended in stop and go traffic at 60 MPH (again, the man was talking on his phone) and again my child was uninjured. My in-laws were rear-ended less than a month ago at 70 MPH (severe enough to be taken to shock trauma) and the seat I had in their car was a less expensive Cosco seat which shattered upon impact.

It is also many expensive.<br /><br />The baby seems comfortable in it.  The bottom is somewhat rounded and provides a train-track style sound when you rock the baby back and forth.  It's supportive while also being plush (at least moreso than most of the carseats we saw).  It's easy to adjust on the fly. Our baby is in cloth diapers that vary in thickness.  The easy adjustments make accounting for the changes simple and safe.  It's not super-easy to break down for cleaning a major...uh, spill, but it can be done in less than 5 minutes, down to the foam lining.  It works great with the stroller & base (as you'd expect), and looks good, too.  It's weight is good (not the lightest, but still good)."

0,3,0,0,3,,"After a good deal amount of research on different convertible car seats, I decided on this. I was so happy with how it looked whe we first received the product. My husband thought that we could have been find with a less costly convertible but after having it for a couple months, my husband has changed his tune. This isn't our first rodeo in the car seat arena being that this was purchased for our 3rd child. I did more research this time around since my son has very bad reflux. My son also tends to run warm and sweats pretty easily. Living in Southern California does not help.<br /><br />The convertible car seat was easy to install and the fabric was easy to remove for cleaning. It still looks and smells brand new even after having multiple episodes of projectile vomiting and blowout episodes that I thought would have ruined the seat by now. Our son also looks much more comfortable, sleeps easily, and last through long trips in this seat. My only regret was not purchasing the seat sooner. I have even recommended it to friends. It is so easy to adjust for different heights without taking out the seat. I tend to go shopping with my sister who usually brings her daughter along. My sister no longer has to bring her high back booster for her daughter when going out with me. It is easy to adjust the seat for her size. We noticed that my niece easily falls asleep and looks more comfortable in the convertible too."

Many boosters that i found did not attatch to the car in any way and were ONLY held down by the child's weight and the seat belt combo. I did not like that the booster could move around in the seat. The Graco Affix is attatched to the car by the same latch system that the infant seats are. It cannot move around and lifts my daughter up where she needs to be while being stable."

It comes off easily when i try to lift my daugher out of the seat or try to recline the seat. I can see thermocol padding underneath.<br />- The grey plastic strapps on the belt is too high and you can't lower it much.

0,0,0,2,1,,"My three year-old daughter (thirty pounds)has been using this carseat since she was six months old, and she has always been comfortable in it. I'm hoping she'll be able to use it for a couple more years.  I have never had any problems adjusting the harness.  I totally disagree with the reviewer who says it is difficult to do so.  This is a great carseat.  It is very safe according to the Baby Bargains book, and the price is reasonable.  I am about to purchase a second one for my son.  I recommended this seat to my good friend and to my sister-in-law.  Both loved it as well.<br /><br />The only complaints I have about it are that it is very wide and it is difficult to clean.  Since I am about to have two of them in the same car, I assume I won't be able to put them right next to each other, so I may just lose the middle seat in the back.  But I haven't tried it yet.  I think it's worth it though.  Yes, my daughter has thrown up in it, and I had to take the back apart in order to get the cover off.  It seems like it should be easier to remove a carseat cover, but it's possible that doing so would sacrifice some of the safety aspects of this seat.  I think anytime your child throws up in the car, it's going to be messy!  So at least it is possible to remove the cover, but you have to take the seat out of your car, bring it into the house, unscrew the back, remove the cover, wash it, hang it up to dry, and then reverse the process.<br /><br />But I like this seat.  Did I mention I'm buying another one?"
2,3,0,0,3,,Super nice and comfy
1,5,4,0,2,,"After researching online and shopping and comparing at several stores. I really believe this is a great car seat for the money. I bought this car seat for my three year old grandson, because we needed a third seat and he really loves it. iIt is much more comfortable than the other car seats he had and they were more expensive. The seat has more padding then the other car seats in the same price range and the Head cushon is great."
1,4,1,1,0,,"Being a Child Passenger Safety Technician Instructor working with Law Enforcement and Fire Rescue personnel all over the Country for 30 plus years, I was very interested to see this product as I love to see new innovations in the field of child passenger safety. The quality of the Mifold was fine and the claims were impressive, but it I feel it stopped there.  I tried five different kids of varying ages on the Mifold. The belt fit was “ok&#34;, a little too low on the thighs in my opinion, but certainly not up on the abdomen.  Before we had even left the driveway, the kids had moved forward on the seat to fold their legs over the edge so I had to take them out of it.<br />In a real world setting, a child does not behave like a crash test dummy and when they have no “BOOST”, which this seat lacks, the child slides forward on the seat to get comfortable.  In order for a child to be able to fold their legs over the vehicle seat, they will slide forward, leaving a gap behind them, which in turn loosens the seatbelt. This is exactly what an actual booster seat should be designed to prevent. Booster seats are designed to position the seatbelt AND to boost the child up to prevent the child from slouching or sliding forward on the vehicle seat. The Mifold seems to only address the belt positioning.<br />I am not happy with the product and definitely not convinced of the safety and will return it."

0,3,0,0,0,,"We've been using this car seat for my now 14mo and so far love it.  We still have it rear facing for extra safety reasons.  Our state allows to go forward facing at 12mo, but we left it rear facing to reduce the risk of injury as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  We debate flipping it forward facing since my child gets car sick and we think it will help but are trying to delay since rear facing reduces the risk of internal decapitation (ie the neck breaks usually leading to death or paralysis) if an accident occurs.<br /><br />What I like about this Graco is the one-handed adjustment for shoulder harness height WITHOUT removing the car seat or rethreading the harness.  After a baby car seat that required rethreading this is awesome!  I also liked the extra padding for the head and around the seat for when my child was younger.  I've now removed the extra head padding and only have the seat padding.  I also like that I can snap each side into the crotch buckle separately - I had a different baby seat that required both to be pushed in together and that was a nightmare with a squirmy child!<br />I've washed this set twice in the washing machine without issues (my daughter vomited in her car seat).  The only negative is that the straps don't come out to wash - I had to wipe them down.<br />My child at the 12mo check up was the average height of a 22mo.  Right now at 14m there is plenty of space for her legs in rear facing position."
1,4,1,1,5,Cup Holder,Perfect product. It comes out far enough on my sons long legs to fit well. The two cup holders are able to be hidden and he loves that.  Also has an adjuster that comes up the back to clip the seat belt away from his neck. Awesome product and reasonable price.

It has just the right amount of soft padding for our babu to be comfortable especially for long car rides. Our son is 2 months old and is tall, I love that we are able to adjust the car seat to different lengths (for a newborn this car seat can fit perfectly, everyone’s baby is different but buy extra newborn padding because our babies are tiny when they leave the hospital but will grow before your eyes in a matter of days)!  I also love that our son will be able to grow in this car seat because this is years worth of money saved.

It made running through the airport to make our connection so much easier than having our hands full with a suitcase, carseat, diaper bag, and kiddo. When disconnecting at the gate, we were easily able to just put the strap into the front pocket of our suitcase. We considered just checking the carseat so we wouldn't have to deal with it at the airport, but were so happy we chose otherwise. When we got to our destination, our checked bags had not made the connection. Thankfully we had our car seat with us. I would recommend this to anyone traveling with a child and a carseat."

2,4,0,0,1,,"My husband and I bought this seat when my son was 6 months. At 6 months he was able to hold his head up and we were able to use position 2 rear facing. In this position it fits in most vehicles. We have used this car seat in the following types of vehicles: Toyota Corolla, Honda CRV (old style), Hyundai, Tucson, Ram 1500 Crew Cab, and Ford F-150 Crew Cab. We did have trouble in the Ford F-150 because we had to use the seat belt method and it would rock from side to side more. This car seat takes up less room then our infant one did and we are vary pleased with it. We have since bought three, one for each vehicle, so we don't have to swap in and out; however, my husband has become an expert and can install it in 5 minutes or less. It's like any car seat the first time sucks and you need to watch YouTube and read the directions but after that it's not bad. I like that the padding is all machine washable which comes in very handy. I have also found packing tape works well to remove crumbs from the cup holders without removing the whole seat. Finally, what's the kids opinion? My son loves his car seat. He likes that he can see out. He's comfortable in it and it stays pretty cool in the summer.  We have taken two vacations with this seat and my son was a champ with the 13 and 15 hour trip. Bottom line, for the money this seat is awesome and we are pleased with our purchases."

3,5,2,0,1,"Online Chat: Chat with our ParentLink customer service experts online in real time, Live Video Installation Support: Schedule an appointment to have a certified car seat safety technician guide you through a proper vehicle installation","This seat by Evenflo comes with a lot of cushion and removable padding which is what allows for the weight range 4-120lbs. For infants you can recline it so the baby is not slouching forward. As the baby grows into toddler, padding is removable to accommodate. As the toddler grows into little kid, headrest is adjustable to accommodate. As the little kid grows into big kid, back is removable and seat turns into booster. It’s really great. 5 point harness is a must but it’s worth mentioning that the child is buckled from 5 different points:2 shoulders, 2 hips and crotch. Buckle is not difficult to handle but it’s childproof. Shoulder straps are padded for added safety and comfort. Color gray is gender neutral and doesn’t get dirty easily. The only downside with having convertible carseat is that you still have to figure out stroller ride for infant. Newborns are too small to only be secured by straps but I guess stroller with the seat that converts into basinet is a solution so that you don’t have to buy nothing other than a stroller and a carseat. I recently reviewed Graco Nest that converts into basinet and back to toddler seat wonderfully. This seat is cushiony and comfortable. My toddler and my 8 months old are both equally comfortable."

Seems very quality, well-built, sturdy, etc.  Is certainly large and cumbersome though, if I were pressed for a complaint, so I wouldn't really plan on being able to move this from vehicle-to-vehicle on a regular basis (maybe ever).  If you are a multi-vehicle family and are considering this, I would probably recommend budgeting for two of these.

1,4,1,1,0,,"The Mifold is an innovative option for children who are ready to ride in a booster seat (over age 5, has the maturity to sit still 100% of the ride). It is NOT an option for all children. I am a CPST.<br /><br />Here's what I love about the Mifold:<br />1) It's tiny and can fit anywhere, it is a good option for three across situations<br />2) It's a great carpooling option because it's so portable a child never needs to be without a seat<br />3) It fits my child (age 7/55lbs/48in) in almost all of the seating positions I tried her in<br />4) It's flat and holds the belt over the strong bones of the pelvis without boosting the child up. This is really useful in cars that don't have head restraints in the back seats<br />5) It doesn't look like a &quot;baby seat&quot; so it can be great for older kids who are still too small to ride in just the seat belt.<br /><br />Here's what I think could be better:<br />1) The fit is dependent on the size of the child and the vehicle that it's used in. I personally had issues in the third row center seat of a 2012 Pilot and the center seat of a 2009 Mazda6. The reason these seating positions were incompatible was because they had belts coming from the ceiling that had a larger second buckle on the side opposite the normal buckle that would not allow the lap belt to get fully tight (see picture). Larger children with more &quot;junk in the trunk&quot; may also have issues with the Mifold because the belt guides must not be touching the child. In a normal booster, this restriction does not exist so this is a problem unique to the Mifold.<br />2) It's not as easy to use as a standard booster. This isn't necessarily a problem- you just need to make sure you're following all the directions and if you're letting your kid carpool with it, make sure they understand how to set it up correctly too.<br /><br />All in all- I'm happy to have it for a travel/ carpool seat. I consider it a niche seat for specific situations- it may be just what you need to keep your kids as safe as possible!"

Fabric does look like it may snag easily though.  Cupholder and kid accessible storage is a bonus.<br /><br />Installation was almost impossible on my 2003 Subaru Forester:<br /><br />1)  tried LATCH - I could not pull it tight enough to secure the seat so that it would not move.  Upon further examination I found that the tightening side of the LATCH strap had run out of room.  There is a strap which attaches the LATCH strap to the seat preventing me from pulling any tighter.  Very disappointed that the LATCH did not work.<br /><br />2)  tried the shoulder/lap belt install - I was able to get it tight, had to use the locking clip on the seatbelt but it was almost impossible to get the locking clip on because the seatbelt buckle (when tight) is behind the seat.<br /><br />After about 1.5hrs of fighting with this seat & a steady stream of profanity, it was in but I am not convinced it's as secure as our Britax Boulevard or PegPerego infant seat that were a snap to install via LATCH.<br /><br />Summary:<br />1)  The one strap LATCH system on this seat is awful<br />2)  Does not work well in a 2003 Subaru Forester<br />3)  Nice lightweight design<br />4)  Don't expect to easily move it between vehicles<br />5)  It's your kid's safety... pay a few $$ more and get a Britax (which I will likely do and put this one on Craigslist)"

While DD1 is close to being able to just use a booster, I liked the idea of keeping her in harness as long as possible.  Nautilus goes to 65# in the harness, and I love we won't even have to buy another booster (however cheap they are) when she outgrows the high-back.  The cupholders are great, better to be built-in than removable (like the Elite) so they don't stick out/fall off.  The cubbyholes are nice, too, for storage.  My only criticism is that I wish it had the ability to adjust the harness height without taking it out (like the Elite)."

0,7,0,2,3,-1-1,"With our daughter outgrowing her infant car seat, we researched and decided on the Britax Boulevard 70 (2012), which we purchased at a local store and put into our SUV, which we drive more often. When it came time to get the second car seat, we purchased this 70-G3 for my car, only because the 2012s were no longer available at as good a price. This one is in my 2-door sports coupe and it still fits rear-facing and in the center seat. I worried it might not fit there, or that it might be hard to see over when looking in the rearview mirror, but all was for naught. It fits great, and it doesn't obstruct my view at all.<br /><br />Between the two versions we have, the main difference that I've noticed is that this 70-G3's straps don't lengthen as much as the older version, meaning we have to work a little harder to get our daughter's arms through when buckling her in. This appears to be a safety feature (&#34;Versa&#34; Tether related). Otherwise, it's a great seat so far. She sweats quite a bit in it sometimes (living in AZ), but car seats are not breathable anyway, so I imagine this would happen in any car seat, especially when rear-facing. The head support is plush and this has the true side impact protection, as well."

0,5,0,0,3,Fits 3 across,"So. I bought this because if the safety features. I have not tested them. hope never to test them actually. And I think they are all that the manufacturers say.<br />However, there are also other tested really good options in the market that would be more friendly for you and your child I think.<br /><br />I do not regret buying it, do not misunderstand me, however, this is not a 5-star product. some design flows are way too evident.<br /><br />1. newborn. definitely not suitable for my newborn. she weighs around 8 pounds, 1-month-old. but still no head control. the result in this seat rear-facing with all the things on to get as vertical as possible, a child with the head bouncing a little, the crushing is not ""puffy"" enough or how could I say it, it does not have enough stuffing at least at the head part, it is too wide! so I put my maybe and she drops her head to one side. that would be ok if she was totally reclined, but this models do not do that, therefore they need a really good Cushing for head control! this is no the case. In addition, even when it is all reclined (at least all it can go) the newborn goes deep into the seat. so the positions of the baby end up really unnatural, the head is not only that stable, but it goes down, her chin touches her chest, that is definitely not good! for a newborn, they need their airways to be totally open.<br />I am not saying that there no solution for this, you can put some stuffing to rearrange the child. BUT, that would make the seat not as safe as intended! so it is a no-win for anyone.<br />MAYBE, I am doing something wrong, I have tried everything to set her upright, but if a regular person cannot adjust her newborn correctly in the seat I think something might be wrong with the seat actually the whole idea is that the car seat needs to be SIMPLE to use. otherwise, it does not matter if is made of titanium, it would not protect the child-like it should<br />which brings me to my second point.<br /><br />2. installation. it is a pain!!! the 1st time it took me 2 hours to install the seat. the manual is not helpful, I had to look online for some video to see how you install it. you have to pass some stuff with your hand through a hole and then adjust it if you want to rearrange the belts on the seat is another hour, because you need to unmount it. It is NOT user-friendly definitely. which makes me go again to my 1st point a seat not easy to install is not a good seat.  however, after you do it 1 time next time it would be easier. still a pain, but easier. I am afraid of when I would have to install it forward-facing.<br /><br />3. the instruction manual is not good in my opinion, not easy explanations.<br /><br />4.  the seat is rigid, which is good for safety but not for comfort while on a long trip with an older child who needs different positions.<br /><br />5. you need angle adjuster and straps sold separately. come on DIONO!.<br /><br />but here are the things why I do not regret this purchase<br /><br />5. We liked the material, they are extremely good, really good material.<br />6. safety seems really good and the safety design seems really good. not tested. but you see this not plastic and some foam like a most car seat.<br />7. many options, one of the few that has together in rear-facing mode.<br />has an extensor for the together also. just too many things around that could get really messy if you are not careful.<br />8. it looks like for an older child this is a really comfy car seat.<br />9. EASY to take around. ok it is HEAVY, but if you get the straps you can carry it as a backpack. really easy to go around! no seat does that.<br /><br />well we will see how it goes in the next months."

I do like that you can pull off all the padding to put in the washer, as we just had a vomit incident this week. The manual is completely inept at telling you where the pads hook back to the seat, though. I gave up on a few of them. I love that the straps position is dependent on the headrest. You don't have to worry as much if the straps are in the right position, because it's easy to adjust.

The car seat I was previously using was a Gracco and it weighed 10lbs-so I wasn’t expecting this. Thank goodness my super brought the box up my 4 flight walk up! When you remove the car seat from the box it has significant weight- which I guess is normal for stationary car seats. So I would suggest having someone around that can help carry the box.<br /><br />The car seat itself is absolutely beautiful! The color, and cushioning really stand out. The car seat comes with instructions as well as a quick install guide- which I thought was cool. I read the entire manual and felt comfortable installing the car seat. My boyfriend (who is a firefighter) would normally do this but he was away on business and I needed to install the car seat ASAP since I already donated the old one. For added safety I watched a few install videos I found online and on YouTube.<br /><br />My son is over 25lbs and I decided to place the car seat forward facing. Per the instructions you can use this care seat in rear facing until 40lbs (I think) but I decided to forward face. The installation was very easy. The only trouble I had was that my car is an older model suv and I couldn’t locate where the tether strap anchors were located. After some googling I figured out they were in the back of the seat located in the trunk. So if you are forward facing I suggest checking on that before you try installing.<br /><br />Once I figured that out installation was super easy!<br /><br />So far my son is super comfortable and seems very happy during our car rides. Everything on this car seat is convenient and easy to operate.<br /><br />Overall this car seat is amazing!"

1,5,1,0,3,,"I purchased two of these from Albee Baby and we love them! First off Albee Baby has very fast shipping!<br /><br />I have a two year old son and he needed a few more car seats because I was tired of installing my Britax marathon in different cars every few days. I bought two gracos so my husband and I each have one in our cars and that way the marathon can stay in grandma's car because it so easy to buckle him properly for her hands.<br /><br />I like everything about these seats! They installed with latch super easy and the install is so tight, it's as if it was built into my cars.<br /><br />I love the fit. My son fits so comfortable in these seats and with the recline feature, plus the natural recline of my back seats it makes naps comfortable for him.<br /><br />Right now he is on the lowest setting and middle crotch buckle slot. I like that there are 3 crotch slots it will make extended harnessing longer easier as he grows.<br /><br />I also love the 10 year expiration(from the date of manufacture). That truly means this seat will last him until he no longer needs a seat, so now I Will just have to replace the britax marathon when he outgrows it.<br /><br />I do love the no rethread harness feature as well, it makes it so much easier not having to take the seat out(which is what I love about my britax.<br /><br />I don't know what some reviews are talking about when they say they can't get the straps tight enough and that it's hard to adjust the straps. On both of our seats it's super easy. Actually it easier to adjust these straps then on my britax.<br /><br />My son loves his new seats!<br /><br />I would recommend these and I love our new seats! I'm glad I opted for two of these instead of the britax frontier."
1,4,1,0,3,,"I would rate this car seat 0 stars if I could. We have only had this car seat for 4 months, Last night we had to cut our child out of the car seat by the straps. After 45 minutes of trying to unlatch it in the cold and rain we could not get our child out. This car seat has major latch issues. Extremely hard to latch and unlatch. Last night it would  not give. My husband is a strong man, he actually bruised and made his thumbs bleed in his attempt to get our 2 year old son out of this seat before having no choice but to cut the straps. After that amount of time trying to get our toddler out, our toddler was in obvious distress. I have wrote graco and am waiting for a response. Considering an attorney and contacting local news station! This is a clear safety issue. Had there been an accident or fire our child would have been in serious danger!!! Why has there been no recall on this car seat??!!!!! Graco are you waiting on a child to be seriously injured or killed first??????"

2,3,0,2,3,,"After really liking the east of the Chicco Keyfit, we went with the Next Fit.  I would return it if I could.  Even after taking it to a car seat check, the pull strap is incredibly hard to tighten.  They didn't understand it either.  And I don't think it's a fluke because we bought two of these carseats and BOTH of them have the same issue.  I have to kneel up on the seat to grab and yank at the strap and it still doesn't feel as tight and secure as the KeyFit did."

Every other car seat was too bulky, even ones that claimed they were slim or could fit 3 across.

1,5,1,2,0,,"We are using this seat in the third row of a 2012 Honda Odyssey.  Our 9 year old daughter originally said this seat was ""like strapping myself to a board"" and very uncomfortable because she was used to the recline of her harnessed carseat.  However, she found the seat much more comfortable when we reclined the actual seat of the vehicle just a smidge.  So it should be fine if you have a vehicle you can adjust the recline of the seats in, but your child might find it uncomfortable if you have seats that are more upright.<br /><br />The other thing to note about this vehicle fit wise in the Honda Odyssey is that although it extends a fantastic 63in, when in the outboard positions in the 3rd row of the Odyssey (and I suspect many other vans), the slope of the roof/side don't allow the seat to raise to it's full height before it hits the sloped side.  Still fits well beyond other comparable high backed boosters though and has a longer expiration than other comparable boosters as well."

I was torn between this one and the extend2fit but went with this one since it can also be used as a booster for all stages! Only one down side I have with it is that unless you have it on recline, when forward facing the child’s head flops forward as the head rest sides do not come out far enough to really support their head when asleep, forward facing. When in my vehicle however my three year old still stays rear facing a so this is not a problem when in rear facing position and on full recline or the one just before it. I also absolutely love the basin color! I’ll be buying another for this baby I’m currently pregnant with as well at 1 year!"

I LOVE the look of the car seat and I LOVE Graco products for their safety and affordability, but DO NOT buy this seat. My baby was SO uncomfortable. The head rest sticks out a good inch from the back rest, forcing my 13 month old's chin into his chest. Rear and front facing it looks like he's totally slouching forward and miserable. We fed him a bottle on our road trip and because he was hunched over and unable to burp, he threw up everywhere, something NONE of my children have ever done in their other car seats. Also when he slept his head kept hanging forward, even in the most reclined position. Not at all safe for his airway. Literally the most uncomfortable seat ever. Needless to say, we've returned it!"

4,4,1,2,0,Cup Holder,This is flimsy and cheap.  It moved all around and we made it tight as we can with our seat belt.  We had to slam on our breaks and the back pushed my son forward. It's snapped into its position too.  I wish I didn't get this and forced to go back to 5 point harness where my kid doesn't  move around in the seat and the seat itself. This needs to be strapped to back of the seat not just seat belt.  This might be good for a 55+ kid. I can't believe it's even sold on the market. We drive a 2013 Honda Pilot and nothing wrong with our seatbelts.
1,4,1,0,3,,"We have had 2 Graco Nautilus carseats in pink for several years now.  Each of my daughters used these seats for 2-3 years, before moving out to a highback booster around age 5 and a half.<br /><br />The other reviews have pretty well covered the pros and cons on this seat.  The cupholders and &#34;cubbies&#34; are big pluses. My girls both rode for very long distances and slept in these fine.  As my oldest got taller, I found that if we put a footrest (or a suitcase or duffle bag) on the floor under her feet for long rides, she did better.  I think her longer legs started to stick out further on the seat and caused some discomfort on 2.5 hour or more cartrips.  Providing some support under her feet fixed that problem.<br /><br />The big disappointment for me about this seat was that it did not work well as a high back booster.  As a new mom, I really believed the sales-pitch that this was a 3 in 1 seat and we wouldn't have to buy a booster.  Not so. While it does function fine as a belt-positioning booster, the child sits so high up that it is nearly impossible for him/her to reach down to actually buckle the seat belt.  If you have the time and patience to buckle your child in each time, this will be fine.  I don't.  So, when the girls got big enough for booster seats, we ditched the Nautilus and went with a true booster (we got the Turbobooster) and they have a MUCH easier time buckling -- which is especially important when you have to move so quickly when they are jumping in the car at carpool pickup.<br /><br />Hope this info is helpful!"

It took a while to get the seat, over two weeks but it was really worth the wait. I would highly recommend this seat to anyone.  The only draw back about installing the seat in the middle and using the outer anchors is that there really isn't enough room on either side of the baby seat for another adult to the seat.

0,7,0,2,3,,"Why is choosing a carseat so difficult and emotionally fraught?! We kept our slim, average-height daughter rear-facing in her Graco Snugride 35 bucket seat until she grew too tall for the straps (22 months, 22 lbs), then started looking for a convertible seat for her to use for the next several years.  After subscribing to Consumer Reports and reading everything I could find on the internet, I narrowed it down to this seat and the Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 based on safety features and user reviews, considering ease of use, comfort, and vehicle fit.  I just couldn't decide, but I knew we would want two seats (one for my CRV and one for my husband's Tahoe), so we bought one of each.  The Maxi-Cosi went in my car, the Britax went in the Tahoe.  I really like them both (and my daughter has no complaints) but I like the Maxi-Cosi better for the following reasons:<br />--the fabric feels and looks nicer and like it will be cooler in the summer (we live in TX)<br />--the seat feels much more cushiony<br />--the &#34;wings&#34; around her head offer significantly more coverage in case of a crash. They also give her head more support. (I was afraid she wouldn't like them because she can't really turn her head to the side, but she doesn't seem to mind so far.)<br />--the Maxi-Cosi has a nice cupholder and more room for her toys to sit with her.<br />--the Britax between-the-legs buckle is strangely positioned -- she's almost sitting on it.<br /><br />Both seats are attractive and fit well (enough) in the vehicles rear-facing. We have only one child, so she sits in the middle seat.  If there were more than one seat, it might start to be an issue in my CRV, but she will be forward-facing before we have another kid, so I'm not too concerned.<br /><br />The Britax does win, hands-down, in one area so far: cleaning.  The M-C seat has to be taken apart to get the cover off, and then has to be hand-washed (what were they thinking?!).  The Britax seat cover comes off easily and washes well.  I know this because it got thoroughly broken in with a spilled cup of milk AND A bout of diarrhea on its very first outing -- UGH!  We were grateful to be able to yank the seat cover off with no trouble, hose it down, and toss it in the washer.  The trickiness of washing it is a definite downside of the Maxi-Cosi, but we're hoping to minimize the issue by not allowing her to eat or drink in that seat. So the fancy cupholder is just for toys, but that still comes in handy.<br /><br />The bottom line is, both seats are terrific and seem very safe, and I would recommend either."
0,5,0,0,1,,"I was a little surprised as to how big it was. I figured it would have plenty of room in my Buick Enclave, but when it's reclined down in to the 1 position it is actually a really tight fit!  Please know though that I am 5'9&#34; so my seat is back a decent ways, and it wouldn't fit if my husband moved the seat back to where he usually does for his 6'5&#34; frame!  It will definitely work though, especially as the recline the position up as baby gets older. I haven't had baby in it yet (due in two weeks) but the padding is very soft. The only thing I didn't see that I was wanting was little slots for the clips to go in while putting baby in. It does in fact have these, which I was very excited to find out! I have been driving around with it in the car for about a week and have yet to notice any of the rattling that people have mentioned. The only thing I saw that could be causing this was the top latch connected to the top back of the seat, which I am not using yet being rear facing. It was kind of a loose fit, so I unstrapped it and tucked it in to the pocket on the back of my seat. However, I plan on trying it how it is supposed to be to see if that makes a rattle.

2,3,0,0,3,,"We have a 12 passenger Ford Transit van. One would think that such a large vehicle would be able to accommodate any seat with ease...one would be pretty sadly wrong. The second row can fit anything since it’s got the most leg room, 2 sets of latches and a tether anchor (which is by the door so I’m not sure why anyone would tether anything there but that’s beside the point). But the second row is the coveted row in our family since we have carsick prone non-car seat riding kids.<br />The third row has less leg room and the fourth the least amount. So fitting anything rear facing is a bear unless it’s something small like a Combi Coccoro...but those don’t accommodate kids for very long since they are so small.<br />I read in a Transit thread that the Extend2Fit will fit in the third row rear facing on recline #4 without the foot rest out. I was skeptical but hopeful! I’m here to tell you it’s true. The seat it’s in, drivers side, has to be reclined, and the seat directly in front of it has to be upright. But it fits and doesn’t even touch the back of the seat in front of it. There is no latch in that position but I got a really solid install with the seatbelt. I know I need to stow the latch in my pics, just didn’t get to it yet :)<br />I’m excited to be able to put a rear facing kiddo in the third row of our van and hope that my 17 month old is comfortable in it and reclined enough not to get the neck flop when he falls asleep!<br />The other features of the seat speak for themselves. Rear facing to 50# is a feat that I hope we can get close to. Gotta keep the kiddos safe!"

Once it is facing forward it will be no problem at all.  Cup holders are great and kid sleeps easily and comfortably for extended periods with no issue.  Adjustment strap for latch system is tough to get to loosen so just do it before you clip it in or it will make you crazy.

1,3,3,2,3,,Bought this for our 10 month old son. Our daughter has an older marathon that we like. I like the new click tight. It is simple to do but does take a little strength to get it to click! I had to put my body weight into it. It feels secure. He seems more comfortable in it. I love the recline option to be sure it is the right angle for his age. (You need to adjust the recline before installing) I did manage to put this rear facing in the middle and our marathon (made in 2011) forward facing on the side next to it in the backseat of our Mercery Milan. I highly recommend. I also love that it came with the bottom buckle protector built in. We bought one of those separately for our marathon. We also have he britax waterproof seat protectors on both seats.

I wanted the same safety and comfort that I trust for my son in my husband's truck but frankly I just didn't want to spend as much for a second car seat.  We decided to try the roundabout and I am so happy we did!  It offers my son all the same safety and comfort as the roundabout but it just isn't quite as convenient.  The straps have to be manually moved from slot to slot so I don't feel like you can custom fit them as well as on the roundabout.  Also, the straps don't lay as nicely in this one they can twist and turn so you have to fiddle with them to get them lined up correctly on your child.  Bottom line for an extra 15 seconds when putting your child into the seat and ten minutes every six months when they grow significantly this is a wonderful bargain."

Both my kids complained about it being very hard on their bottoms; one kid was OK with it, the other complained a lot. Better for short trips than long rides in the car, for that reason.<br /><br />The price is fantastic, the seat itself is a lifesaver. Really great product."

0,4,0,0,5,,So I have had a horrible time with car seats fitting perfectly in my car. I have an Acura TSX sedan. It’s very small. Most rear facing seats were wiggling and not secure or too large to where my front seats had to be up very high. Just installed this one and it fit great. The latches hold it in place. Also I love the head rest that can be adjusted up or down easily. I also love the swivel cup holders. The padding seems extremely comfortable. It doesn’t take up too much width either. I can still fit my other two booster seats on either side. Love this car seat!
4,2,0,0,1,,Excellent design and material. My goal was to have a car seat that could be left in the car in addition to the one that would stay in the stroller.  This one is beautifully made with all the options you need. Nice quality material.
1,4,1,0,3,,This product is perfect for a growing child.  We bought it originally for my 3 year old son who out grew every car seat we have.  I loved it so much we bought another one.  After the holidays we are replacing the other two we have for my 1 year old daughter.  I even bragged so much about it to my friends they bought it as well.  I'm happy my son and daughter will both be able to be in a 5-point harness for a long time.

2,3,3,0,3,,"The strap release button is awful (to loosen straps when getting kid out of seat), even worse than older model of carseat. The clicktight button is too prevalent for something you do not use everytime you put kid in/out of seat, but strap release is hidden. Grandparents cannot figure out this feature. Installation required a you tube video because instruction booklet is not clear enough. I HATE that the fabric is not machine washable. The carseat itself works fine. I feel like I can get kid in and strapped in safely. The kid doesn't complain about comfort. I have 2 of these plus an older model of this seat all in the second row of a Honda Odysseu."
2,3,0,0,5,,WAY too hard to tighten the straps. No matter how hard I pull or even if I loosen them all the way out and start all over the straps don't tighten enough.

The seat is very user-friendly (easy to adjust) and it's not quite as gigantic as the Britax seats (the Marathon eats up my husband's whole back seat!).  I didn't give it 5 stars because it doesn't seem quite as comfortable as the other cars seats I own.

0,4,0,0,5,,works great and has multiple options on how to install it in your car. rear facing was a little lacking in leg room and the moment he got to state requirements where i could turn him around i did because the poor guy was cramped back there and shoes always got stuck on the cup holders when putting him in during the rear facing. love it for the forward facing. its slim but just not as slim as i thought it would be in a 3 seat row you really only are going to be able to fit the car seat and one adult comfortably. otherwise it needs to be skinny people sitting next to the car seat and if there is another car seat you only can fit 2 not 3 next t one another.
1,4,1,1,0,,"This seat is definitely small and compact. Unfortunately it doesn't work very well in the bucket-like back seats of my sedan. Since it doesn't boost his body up, his legs either are left getting hyper-extended, or he tries curling them up sideways while sitting (an extremely unsafe alternative is to let them slouch/slide down so their legs can bend over the edge of the seat). About 15 minutes into the drive to the store (16 minutes away), he began crying and screaming in fear as he felt his leg was being broken. It took a few minutes for the built-up stress/pain on the leg bones to go away.<br />I read something similar in another review, and it seems like a 'booster' seat is needed to raise the child up so their legs can bend naturally without encouraging them to slide out. This seat does not accomplish/allow that."

0,3,3,0,3,,"Agree with another reviewer that it is built like a tank. However, it just seems like the most awkward design being user unfriendly and uncomfortable for my son.  We started using this when he was 9 mo old almost outgrowing the infant seat.  The straps going around the thigh and buckle between the legs are one, hard to get on him and clicked in, two: too tight, three: the buckle is so wide it does force his legs to be frog leg and I imagine as he starts walking and his legs straighten out it will really dig in.  Ugh just frustrating to use this and I wish I could return it"
1,0,1,2,5,Cup Holder,Nice quality car seat!  I got this for my 6 year-old.  I like it because it's gender-neutral and can be passed down to her brother years later.  Kids love the compartments that can hold 2 drinks AND 2 snacks!  Nice!
4,2,0,0,0,,"I wanted to love this car seat, I had used baby trend previously with my older two sons but this one was very disappointing. It’s very cheaply made. You can tell by the plastic of the car seat, it feels like it could snap easily. Maybe that’s what makes it “lightweight” Especially once comparing it to other brands of car seats it was obvious. The base is also very flimsy when installing into the car, it wobbles and flips everywhere, the tighter you pull the seat belt the more the base flips up on the other end. I do not feel like my son is safe in this car seat system. I wish I could exchange for another brand."
1,5,1,2,2,Integrated LATCH connectors,"Our daughter was too tall for the booster with the back attached so we opted for this one.

1,3,0,0,0,Removable Seat Cushion,"We have a Chico NextFit it my truck and this in my wife's MDX.  My wife went with the Britax based on the glowing reviews and not liking the force it takes to tighten the straps on the NextFit (until you get the hang of it I admit it is tough while hanging out of a full size truck).  That said, after struggling for close to an hour to get this Britax installed and leveled we were about to send it back.  We finally found out there is a line to use for leveling instead measuring the angle as shown in the manual. Why they don't have a level attached like others and why they would recommend using a pool noodle or towel to level it instead of having more reclining positions is a bit bewildering.  For me, after messing around with the Britax, I'm sold that I made the right choice with NextFit.  It went in way easier, it leveled in seconds, our son has more room to grow and stay rear facing, the excess strap had places to tuck it in, and it just feels more secure.  Sure it's a little more work to get him in and out of it, but I already trust it way more than the Britax."
4,4,0,0,2,,"Car seat is great, this was my second purchase of one to replace my oldest's car seat to match his little brother's style. Downside however, is the Taylor looked grey to me in the picture. Unfortunate mistake, luckily my three year old doesn't care. Haha. Anyways, you can't beat the price of the seat. Seems nice and sturdy in my truck, pays to get a seat protector with a rubber style non slip coating. Seems somewhat mobile on my leather seats even when cinched tight. So if you happen to be a color blind Dad, 'Taylor' is pink apparently. :)"

0,3,0,2,3,,"My husband is a Certified Carseat Technician for his police department - needless to say, he was pretty picky when it came to getting our son a car seat.  We bought this one for him for his first birthday.  He's a little guy (always in the 5th percentile for his weight and about 20th percentile for his height) and he fit perfectly when we moved him to this carseat the week after his first birthday.  He's now almost 19 months old and we still have his rear facing... it's the safest way to be in the car and he fits just fine still!  His legs are a little bent against the backseat but he doesn't know any different and has never complained.  And as my husband says, he'd rather have a son with a broken leg from being rear-facing than a son with a broken neck from the whiplash of being forward-facing if we're ever in a crash.  We've owned this for about 7 months now and I'm noticing a little bit of discoloration where my son's head rests, but you have to look pretty closely to see it.  Overall very happy!!"
0,2,0,2,3,,"PLEASE READ! SAFETY ISSUES!!!!<br />I purchased this set 14 months ago and absolutely loved it until recall after recall for serious safety issues!  One recall was with the connection for the car seat not clicking into the stroller, causing the car seat to fall out of the stroller while in use. If that doesn't scare you, I drove out of town by myself today with my 14mth old and the chest plate buckle harness broke. I called the manufacturer and they are closed for the weekend. I looked up my Warranty with the manufacturer and only have a 1 year warranty. Come to find out, there was a recall for that harness buckle breaking and becoming a choking hazard very recently. I had to find the closest store and drive down side roads for miles to buy a brand new car seat with my baby not safely harnessed !!!!!<br />This car seat only lasted 14mths!

0,2,0,0,1,,"I purchased this car seat because of the high safety reviews for Evenflo Triumph.  I first looked at other Triumph car seats at the retail store to take measurements, test the sturdiness, and have a visual on how my 14 mos. old would look in it.  This seat does not disappoint.  I like the convenient knob feature to adjust the harness.  The recline feature is  nice but could only be fully utilized when the seat is in the rear facing position.  The seat itself is a nice design and the cushions appear to be easy to remove for washing.  The only disappointment was that the picture is deceiving, in that the color is not the light beige with gray trim, but actually a light gray microfiber material with black trim.  As far as the size, it is big but so are many others, with the different being a couple of inches.  I am very happy with this purchase, and my baby loves this seat in that she can easily see out the car windows and it is so soft that she is comfortable enough to fall asleep during the long car rides we take."

4,0,4,1,3,"Removable Tray, Safety Harness, Folds for Easy Transport and Storage",Wanted to love this seat since other chicco products are very nice but the tray is so hard to attach. It requires both hands and a lot of manipulation to force it to snap into place. We have a fisher price booster and that tray can be attached with little effort compared to this.
1,3,3,2,3,,"This review is after 3 months of use. The bad: it's heavy, it's expensive, the shoulder straps twist and never pulls to even lengths. One side always has more slack than the other despite me checking and reinstalling multiple times. The crotch lap button is super sticky, so is the chest buckle. I get that it's suppose to be child proof but it's parent proof too.  My 20 month old is in the 15% for size and I am not sure how this seat is going to seat him as he grows. The thumb hole is stupid. My kid got car sick and it was filled with puke. My husband's finger can't fit in the hole to loosen the strap. I almost broke my finger trying to press the button. The button itself is deep down that hole and if you yank your hand out too quickly with a squirming toddler you can get hurt. I've already tore my fingernails a few times. That stupid twisted click tight button  gets stuck all the freakin time!!!!! I struggled to get the seat down to &#34;click&#34; but it doesn't, so I try to lift it back up, but it won't. It was stuck in between not properly installed and a f-you state. Mind you this carseat came highly recommended, price wasn't in issue for me, I read multiple reviews, watched all the instructional videos online and bought the dang thing. The good: It's cushier than most convertible care seats. I hear it's safe but I don't see how if I get hurt using it on a daily basis, the straps are twisted and uneven and I'm sure my son would be injured in it if I don't take the extra 5 mins to try to even the legnth of the strap. It should take one or two mins to strap your kid in, max! An exrtra 5 mins is eternity.  Basically it is more bad than good. I don't understand how this monstrosity gets such high reviews. We got a Safety first convertible seat for my husband's car. It was a pain to install and not as cushy but I feel better that I can strap him in properly on a daily basis. Don't pay the extra $150 for brand name and the sound of that click. I promise you, you will hear more expletives coming out of your mouth trying to deal with this car seat on a daily basis than that elusive click. I am looking into returning it but the husband toss the box. I may put it out to consignment."

0,7,0,2,3,,"We bought this car seat about a month ago and so far it has met every expectation :)  The only downside is that when rear facing the car seat is great but we know when we turn it around to forward face it is going to take up more room in the back seat area because the gray plastic things on the side of it stick out more.  Also I didn't find the strap ""holders"" useful.  Its just Velcro and doesn't really keep the straps to the side the way the video says but all in all we would definitely purchase another one if needed!"
0,3,0,2,1,,"I bought this car seat for use in the back of my 2000 VW Beetle. We normally take my daughter places in our Jeep, and I wanted this for a second seat. I like this one 10x better than the more expensive one we bought for our main vehicle. [[ASIN:B005CG4K6W Evenflo Titan Elite Convertible Car Seat - Camille]]. We have had no trouble with the straps twisting like the other one. I am seriously considering switching the two. This just goes to show that a higher price doesn't always equal a better product!"
2,4,0,0,1,,"Bought this for my 9 month old, with the hopes it will last him for several years. It has held up great so far and seems incredibly safe. Lots of padding without being constricting. The belts each snap in individually, which is great because other car seats models often have them overlaying each other before snapping in, which is a giant pain. Our only slight gripe with this seat is that it does not seem to have any declining angle to it. Generally this is fine, but with the kid falls asleep, he's essentially sitting straight up and his head bobs and knocks. I feel if it had just a few degrees of decline the child would naturally be able to lay back just a bit. But all in a great seat."
2,3,3,0,3,,"I am a big fan of Britax. The strollers, the car seats, all of what I've used by them, I love. With this model, there's a lot to love... The clicktight feature is very cool and convenient. The tightening strap to snug in your wee one's safety harnesses feels way better than any other I've used. The stowaway compartments are very neat. The backside tie-down is well designed. The only thing keeping me from &#34;5-star loving&#34; this one is the reclining feature being a bit tricky, When you install the seat in it's standard position, my assumption is you want to have it safely strapped tight and firm, but this works against the ease of reclining. It seems like in order to recline your little tyke, you'd need to loosen the safety straps, which would require you to raise the clicktight latch, which would require you to remove your kid. To be fair, this might all be intentional and unavoidable for safety reasons and I might be wanting something that would then make the car seat dangerous and defeat the whole purpose. Whatever the case may be, I still think the product is great and recommend it."

1,4,1,0,3,,We just upgraded my 3 year old from her convertible car seat to this seat. She loves the little cubbys to store her toys and also loves that the cup holder holds larger water bottles (such as kids camelback) instead of sippy cups. The fabric looks easy to take care of and take off to wash. I watched a few YouTube videos about this seat before buying it and loved all the features it has-We've always been happy with Graco!
1,5,1,2,3,Cup Holder,"Finally it hit me about my 6 year-old's safety...He was using his functional Evenflo booster seat but he ends up looking uncomfortable in many of our long hour drives here in CA. I never thought Britax could offer a booster seat this secured. I had my first experience with Britax right when he graduated from a baby carrier at 4 mos old. So when he graduated again from Britax convertible seat, I thought I could just grab whatever booster seats out there, which I did.. however there's always a cloud of guilt whether I was doing this right for my Julian. We have upgraded 2 different new cars for more comfort but how could we missed Julian's comfort! Until one day off from work, I started browsing online and bumped into this Britax Pinnacle. I got it on sale too! Click tight system is awesomely the BEST! I have my hubby moved the installed Britax Pinnacle( I did it myself too) but hasn't budged an inch-LITERALLY! This will be the last and the best car seat in the household. Please, parents out there don't miss out on this!"

1,4,1,0,3,,"I did a lot of research and chose to go with this one based on price and safety. I wanted the Diono Radian RXT but it was way more expensive and new so the reviews weren't out yet. I can't say since I haven't actually tried a radian but I think I should have forked out the extra cash. Yes, the Nautilus is heavy and safe but it is extremely annoying as well. I have a 2010 RAV4. The Nautilus sits up so high that I literally have to pick my 3 year old son up with both arms with him in a sitting position and plop him into it. I end up banging his head, twisting his arm, etc... every other time. He can't climb into it himself unless I want him stepping all over the seats with his wet shoes. Even if he does climb in himself I then have to dig for the belt buckle from under his butt. I'd say most parents put their kid behind the pasenger seat so they can see them when they turn around, why then is the cup holder on the right arm? If there is a cup in there I have to remove it everytime I want to get him in and out. Like I want to juggle a cup when I am already usng both arms to lift my son into his car seat. Also, a lot of car seats are tough to tighten and unbuckle, this one is no different. It was not the ""best buy"" I was looking for."

We already have the original marathon for my daughter.<br />- The shoulder strap adjuster is absolutely the most amazing thing I have ever seen on a carseat! When the harness straps need to be moved up as the child grows it literally takes 1 second..no rethreading!<br /><br />- I use the LATCH anchors, so I cant comment on the ease of installation with a belt, but the lock offs are under the seat padding now rather than on the outside.<br /><br />- I have camouflauge and find it adorable!!!<br /><br />- The seat it visibly shorter than the original marathon...I think I read somewhere its about 1/2 inch shorter. I dont think we will make it to 40 pounds RF. My son at 7 months is only 16 pounds but 80% in height. Not that 1/2 inch makes a world of difference. My daughter is 2 1/2 and still RF at 28 pounds.<br /><br />- I really like the little body pillow pad...my 7 mo old still uses it because he is so skinny. Makes the carseat nice and comfy.<br /><br />Great carseat. Glad I got it."

I wouldn’t like it for every day use in our own cars, but to be able to throw it in a day bag and take it instead of larger boosters while traveling or for city use in Lyft/Uber/cabs, it is such a fantastic design.<br /><br />Doesn’t elevate the child, but brings the seatbelt strap to a safe level for their shoulder height. So if your child will be fussy about not seeing out the window, perhaps consider a different option.<br /><br />These seem sturdier than the Bubblebum travel booster, in that there’s no internal part to inflate (or get leaks, which happened after significant use with one of ours).<br /><br />I can’t wait until our littlest just needs one of these to travel instead of a full car seat!

From my perspective, is really is hard to consider the Evenflo. The foot print of the seat is smaller than the Britax.  The booster seat requires a small amount of assembly.  I will use it as a back up option for carpool pinches but for the meantime I will keep my children put- but the oldest really likes the idea of being a big girl and using a seat belt..."

2,3,0,0,3,,"It was time to upgrade my daughter's car seat as she has outgrown her Chicco Keyfit 30. I LOVED the Chicco seat, but couldn't afford to spend $700 for two Chicco Nexfits, so I did some research on a more affordable, yet easy-to-install and easy-to-clean convertible rear-facing seat. After much deliberation (and asking around), I settled on the Extend2Fit.<br /><br />The seat itself is plush, sturdy and comfortable for my daughter. She dozed off easily in it. It fits well in the backseat of my Honda Civic and my husband's Jeep Wrangler, though taller drivers in compact vehicles may have to install the seat on the passenger side in order to have enough room.<br /><br />The Latch install was pretty simple. I had to tug hard to get the seat tight enough, but I was able to manage.<br /><br />Loosening/tightening the harness straps is not as convenient as it was in the Keyfit, but it's not the end of the world. For half the price of my original first choice in convertible seats, I'm really pleased with the Extend2Fit.<br /><br />I have yet to try to wash any of the padding, so I can't say it's easy to clean as the infant seat was. This is an important feature to me and the seat does advertise as being easily cleaned. So let's hope it's true."

0,4,0,0,0,,"This car seat is so versatile, even the safety inspectors at the police installation event were impressed. This carseat can take a beating from a toddler, but is also very padded and comfortable for long car trips for both rear facing infants, and forward facing toddlers. The cover is also easy to wash, and it's so nice to have a second base in our other car so we can easily move the seat from one vehicle to the other. It is quite heavy, so moving it from one base to another can be a little challenging, but the safety ratings make it totally worth it! I also love that once the base is installed, the seat goes between rear and forward facing without ever having to change the base. I can't see us ever needing to buy another carseat now that we have this one, but if we did, we would come back and buy this one again!"

0,5,0,2,3,,I wanted a seat that would last a very long time for my boy. I have used a few different seats before I gave in and tried this one. The most important thing for me was that his head does not fall forward when he falls asleep in the car. He is forward facing (over 18kg). The material is nice and the seat very plush. I would want to sit in it if I could. Installing it was a little hard but I found some great tips in the questions section that made it easier.  The seat is also nice and wide with enough room for them grow. I am saving up for another.

When I carry the car seat on my arm it’s normally rested against my leg as I’m walking. I seriously have like 10-15 little dot bruises on both legs from the plastic pieces sticking out the side of the car seat. I would not buy again or recommend to anyone else.<br />It also gets stuck in the base when trying to take it out of the car, you have to kind of jerk it and grab the bottom and lift while holding the release on the back."

1,5,0,0,2,,"I was having back issues all throughout my pregnancy and it never went away afterwards. This car seat swivels so it's super easy to load up your baby and to pull them out. I did need a little bit of installation help from someone who had already installed another one of these seats in a different car, but we were done in under an hour from start to finish. The installation booklet is kind of vague on details, but there is a video on YouTube from the company that does a better job of showing you what to do.<br /><br />Big pro: The inserts and cover are really easy to take off and figure out how to put back on after a wash. I think there were only four or five main pieces. Other car seats are like a 500 piece puzzle."

0,3,0,0,0,,This seat is really big! I have an 07 Toyota 4-Runner & rear facing is do-able but really tight! It fits better when it's forward facing but takes over the part of the seat next to it.

1,4,1,0,3,,"The car seat I really wanted wouldn't deliver to an APO, but this one is good.<br />Pros:<br />it will fit a tall child<br />has a cup holder<br />can use be up to 100lbs<br />will deliver to APO address<br />Cons:<br />the cup holder is not removable and cannot change sides<br />the crotch strap won't last until 65 lbs (for my child)<br />My issue is where the seat belt buckles from the crotch area. My kid is 4.5 years, 43 inches tall and 40 lbs. he has plenty of room in the head and torso area, but the crotch strap won't fit him much longer. Ideally I'd like to use the 5 point harness until he is at least 5. I'm sad about this because I bought this car seat to replace one he grew out of. If using the 5 point harness is not an issue after 4.5 years or 65 lbs then it is not a worry. My child sometimes tries to escape which is why I like using the 5 point harness. Graco if you read these reviews try to increase the distance the crotch strap goes for older children. I'd do it myself, but I don't want to jeopardize my child's safety.<br /><br />Update: If the Frontier (my first choice) would have delivered to my APO address that is the one I would have bought. I'm saying this now because quite frankly my friend's frontier is holding up better than this Graco. This one is okay, maybe it is better for a petite girl, but it doesn't have the same shoulder height or distance in the crotch area however width wise it works fine. My friend's tall six year old can still buckle up in his Frontier. I had to remove the harness for my five year old and I had to cut out the crotch strap (the only way to get it out) because my kid was doing stupid things while playing with it. I also hate where the water bottle goes. I have to bend over it to buckle my kid in and it hurts getting a water bottle poking in my chest. If my kid followed instructions I could have him hold it and put it in the cup holder afterward, but I'm not going to put it on the driveway only for it to rollaway as I stand on my tip toes to buckle the kid in, or place it on the floor only to be kicked in the head when I retrieve it. It would be nicer if I could have chose where the cup holder went or if it was on both sides because then I would still have a choice.<br />Also I had to remove the harness When my son was 5 yrs and 45 inches tall (OCT 2013) because the chest and crotch straps were too tight. I hope this review can help a parent if they are looking for a car seat for an older child. Currently my child is 5.5 and can unbuckle himself, but our rule is only when the engine turns off. Somehow he follows that rule."

I love the fact that this had the easier installation and oh yes it was! For the first time I did not have to enlist the help of my son-in-law to get the car seat back installed in the backseat. What I really liked about it was the cupholders because my grandson is six years old so he always wants a drink or some toy with him in those cupholders are invaluable for holding those things. This foam is much plushier that my previous seat. For those with infants and toddlers, you will love the magnetic chest harness! So much easier to get on and off and no struggling searching for straps. Like all of these car seats it’s expensive, but I found that the convenience in so many of these features made it worth it and it’s the same price as all of the other higher quality seats.

At 6 months old she is the size of most 12-14 month olds..<br />Anyhow, it was tough finding a seat to accomidate her height and still function as a rear facing seat.

She sits back, cozies in, and is 100% comfortable and content.<br /><br />Other reviews mention that installation is difficult, and takes 2 people...<br />I managed to vacuume the van and install the seat by myself in under 30 minutes.<br />If you take a peak at the enclosed manual (located on the lower back/bottom of the seat) it clearly shows (with pics), and dictates how to properly install the seat.

If you absolutely have to use a shoulder belt or lap belt that can be somewhat trying, however just pop the clips off the seat pad, flip back seat pad, an bam!!!

0,3,0,2,3,,"This is absolutely the best car seat of this type we've had. We bought it after our nephew was in a car accident and we felt we wanted a safer seat for our 3-year-old. It is very sturdy, the fabric is cute and durable, and it fits surprisingly snugly in my car. It fits better than our old Graco carseat, which LOOKED narrower but was actually wider. My son tells me it is a lot more comfortable than the old car seat too. It is a bit heavy to carry, but I'm assuming that's because it has metal side-impact bars which are heavier and safer. It takes a little more time to install in the car, but, again, that's because it is safer. It comes with all the attachments you'll need to fit it into any kind of vehicle. It's easy to buckle so kids can do it themselves (with supervision, of course), but they can't unbuckle it. It is easy to adjust the straps. You have to take the time to read the manual when you are setting up the straps initially. Overall, a great product and so well-worth the money. Car safety is one area we don't want to be cheap."

1,4,1,1,0,,"The obvious advantage of the MiFold is the tiny size. This is much smaller and more convenient than anything else I've come across. I have been using a SafeRide4Kids vest before now.<br /><br />The downside is that as a first generation product, it has some unpolished aspects to it. The huge one is the very irritating seatbelt clips. Neither the lap clips nor the shoulder clip are convenient to use- they are fiddly to put on, and the lap clips are a huge PIA to take off quickly.<br /><br />A minor downside is the long shoulder strap flops around when the device is folded down. An elastic loop would go a long way to helping with this.<br /><br />All in all, I like this product, but the clips are causing me to consider buying the new SafeRide4Kids vest which has seen a lot of hot and bulky body material removed."

0,2,1,0,1,,We have had this car seat for 8 months now and I HATE it! We hardly ever use it and when we do it stays in the car and never comes out. The handle is broken and stuck down so I can’t carry it or move it in and out of the car. The back panel doesn’t stay closed so the harness settings are exposed. The seat is also VERY heavy. The only thing I like is that it’s comfortable for my baby. Such a disappointment and waste of money!

Our need was in its first use, and my daughter became carsick on our way to the Grandparent's house....what a mess.  But you wouldn't know!--cleaned up great."
1,4,0,0,0,,"I bought this seat for a plane ride and to use in Europe.  The light weight was a big factor in this.  Carrying a Britax Boulevard around on your back (using pac back) is doable, but at almost 24 lbs also really cumbersome and heavy when traveling solo with a toddler.<br /><br />What I liked was the fact that the straps can go quite high.  My daughter is 30lbs at 3.5 years, which means that we can use it with the 5 pt harness for quite some time, it'll allow for her to grow.<br /><br />I'm spoiled with the Boulevard though, install with seatbelts is much easier with that seat than with this one.  It's very hard to get it tight enough so that the seat doesn't move.  It lacks the built in snaps that tighten the seatbelt with the Britax.  The clip is a bit of a joke, I have not been able to get it tight with that at all (this was after trying for about 1 hour).<br /><br />It installs very tightly with the latch belt though.  However, in Europe I haven't seen many cars with Latch (Isofix).<br /><br />This'll be a backup seat later.  It'll probably travel with us on the plane again.  It'll never be the main seat, we'll be using the Britax for a lot longer.<br /><br />I'm not overly impressed with the belt positioners, it seems to be too tight and will be hard to keep snug once we get to that point."

The front of our van was destroyed but my little boy (who was seated behind the driver) was completely fine.  This car seat is a tank and I know he is very safe in it.  I love Diono and their customer service is excellent.  I chatted with c.s. because I had a lot of questions about the RXT vs. 3RXT.  She was very patient and helpful.  We considered going with another company to get a replacement seat that sounded fine and was cheaper but we decided Diono is more than worth it.  We've seen the proof.  The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because it is such a pain to install.  It's very heavy and the instructions are not clear.  There are no videos on the 3RXT.  It would be great if Diono would put one on their website.

Only one complaint...the belt path threading at the top headrest tends to catch the belt in the plastic crevice where it is attached to the seat.

0,7,0,2,3,,"I am absolutely thrilled with this car seat. We originally had another car seat with a latch system that wouldn't work in our car. We installed it with the help of our fire department, and we were horrified to find that our son was wiggling it loose by pushing on the back of the seat. It simply wasn't safe. Our son is small for an 18 month old, and keeping him rear facing is a safety necessity. After much shopping, we decided to make the investment in the Britax. My husband fought tooth and nail against spending the money, but we couldn't ignore the steel reinforcements and compact size.<br /><br />We received the car seat two days after our purchase, which was an amazing bonus, even with free shipping! Installation could not be easier. The latch system is ingeniously designed with both straps coming from the front, not the rear like other seats. 5 minutes, and the car seat was comfortably installed in the middle, rear facing. The bonus of the tether system meant that the car seat did not budge. My husband pushed on it as hard as he could, but it didn't move an inch.<br /><br />The best part is that our son loves it. The fabric is soft and comfortable, the side wings support his head when he snuggles against them to go to sleep during long car rides. The straps are so easy to adjust, and clearly more comfortable than the ones on our old car seat. The seat has a very small foot print and fits in our very small car.<br /><br />This was a brilliant investment. We got our money's worth, and I sleep easier at night knowing that the car seat is the safest seat money can buy."

1,4,1,0,3,,"Took a risk and bought this sight unseen.  I am very pleased.  Installation is easier than a Britax Roundabout, although taking is back out is harder (different LATCH buckle).  I love it that there are hard plastic guides for the booster seat car seat belt.  I've been looking for this for years as the sewn ones catch the seat belt and then it hangs loose.  I love the adjustable head rest.  I agree that one handed in or out is easier in the Roundabout, but I never looked at a Frontier.  The seat is not as cushy as the Roundabout, I was a little disappointed, but no complaints from my daughter.  Love the cupholder and the cubbies, although they may attract grunge.  My only question is how the harness can truly go to 65 lbs with the top harness slots as they are.  My daughter is not quite 4, and 30 lbs and seems to need the highest strap setting now.  Something to investigate if you have a tall child.<br /><br />I was able to install very securely in my Mazda minivan, but ONLY if I took the headrest off.  If your headrests ""jut out"" over the seat back and are not removeable, try before you buy.<br /><br />This is a great seat for the price.

We wanted something simple for a spare to have at the house incase his everyday car seat was somehow not available or another family member needed to pick him up unexpectedly.

My 3 year old granddaughter only had slight bruising on her neck unlike me that ended up with a thick bruise outlining my seat belt. We were in  a Ford Fiesta and got plummeted by a USPS mail van that failed to stop for a red light. She was so well protected. I'm forever grateful.
0,4,0,0,3,,"We're very happy with the Graco Milestone car seat.  Seems comfortable for our 15 month old.  It's super easy to adjust as he grows, just pull the lever and move the back up.  The shoulder straps go up with the back, no need to rethread the straps.  We bought it before we went on a long trip and it worked great.  There is an adjustment to lay the seat back for different age kids.  We used it to lay our little one back to sleep.  We can reach back from the front seat and pull the lever to lay it down when he gets tired.  The adjustment goes nearly horizontal which allowed him to sleep comfortably without putting a kink in his neck.  I would highly recommend this car seat."
0,2,1,2,0,,So far this is a great Carseat. I have only used it for one week.  It is lightweight and I still feel like it is good qulaity and great protection for my baby.  I love the quick click connect on the graco products.
0,2,4,0,0,,"I owned all Graco things when I had my son 5 years ago so I can say from experience that their products have definitely taken a turn downward in quality. I got this car seat mostly because it was the only Graco one I could find in pink and I really liked that brand before so I wanted to go with it again. It was cheaper than the other options but I just thought that was because it was an older model. I didn't get the more expensive seat so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt in saying it is just their 'low end' model.<br />While I'm sure the seat itself is safe, it is pretty cheaply made. The canopy doesn't open or close very easily, I have to tug it both ways pretty hard and work with it to get it completely open or shut. The cover on the car seat fits tight in the seat so it's not a suffocation hazard but is really loose around the bottom of the car seat.<br />We still had the base from five years ago so I can also tell you the base is SUPER low quality on this one. It used to be much heavier duty and had a better mechanism for making sure the seat is at the right angle for the baby (there was a ball thing in the side). This one just has a red line that you have to somehow figure out whether or not it's 'parallel' to the ground below the vehicle... The base doesn't need to be lightweight, it stays in the car. I'd much prefer the superior quality.<br />As the seat and the base do seem safe, I'll use it but the quality digression between now and five years ago is pretty astounding."

1,5,4,0,2,,"I bought this car seat about a month ago to replace a similar style Graco that had a broken LATCH connector. The first thing I noticed was how lightweight and flimsy it was compared to the Graco. Basically every time my 3 year old grabbed the headrest while climbing in, he bent it back an inch or two. It is easy to take in and out, and my child is secure when fastened in. So it's not terrible for the price but next time I'll pay more for a better one."

1,4,1,0,3,,"Great Seat, very comfy. We upgraded to this seat from a Graco infant seat. Daughter was 12mo & 20lbs.  I was concerned that she would be too small for it and although the seat looked big for her, she fit snugly.  My only disappointment was the 3 position recline.  It hardly declines, maybe an inch?!  Since my daughter is still young & sometimes falls asleep, her head does tip forward. It's not enough of a recline for her, maybe when she gets bigger? The color & cloth is nice, thick but still comfy. No problems with the latch, she was used to the same one in her Graco infant seat.  She loves the cupholder.  She can barely reach it but loves to put her bottle in there. Then lean over & grab it again. I would definitely recommend this seat.  I read lots of reviews before purchasing it. Again, only disappoinment was the recline was not enough."
2,3,3,0,3,,"This seat is amazingly easy to install! We’d debated over whether we “needed” the click-tight version and I’m so happy we decided to go for it. We’ve easily moved it between cars. The seat appears comfortable (kids have liked their Britax seats over some other brands we tried) and the straps are easy to adjust. We started with a Britax seat for our eldest several years ago, moved up to a Britax booster, and happily continue with the brand for our youngest.<br /><br />A con is weight. It’s heavy, really heavy."
4,7,0,2,3,-1-1,"To be more specific, I would rate this just over 4.5 stars.<br /><br />My daughter has been a different person since we switched to this car seat.  She almost never cries in the car, unless she was crying before being in the car haha, and is noticeably more comfortable.  She's still rear facing, and now is able to see out of the window.  It's definitely safe, and it looks like no shortcuts were taken on padding and support.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I recently had to clean glass from our window being shattered out of the car seat, and found out that this seat is very easy and simple to clean even if you have to remove the clothe.<br /><br />An additional positive before my only negative, this car seat is larger than the one we previously had, and yet it gives us more room in the car.  My passenger seat does not have to be as far up as it used to be.  So if you're hesitant on this model because of the size, you might be very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Only Con:<br /><br />It's incredibly difficult to remove/reinstall if you have to switch cars or need it out for any reason.  I understand that I could view that as a safety feature, but in the rain, heat, cold, etc, it's not fun to take out and put back in."
4,4,0,1,0,,"I’m not really sure why this car seat has such bad reviews. Yes the tie downs that aren’t super secure are a little weird but this car seat is honestly fairly cheap for what you get.<br /><br />I don’t have to worry about it moving a ton when the kids aren’t in it. The kids still love it because they can use the normal seat belt and they get a cup holder that is really steady since it doesn’t go in like the other Graco models. Is it the safest car seat on the market in this style? Who really knows? I appreciate the reasonable price range and the basic features so it’s reasonable to move from car to car for whoever happens to have the kids that day.<br /><br />This was actually a back-up for grandmas car that we took to use full time when our second son needed a car seat if that tells you how much we truly did like it.<br /><br />If you found this useful, make sure to click helpful/yes so others like you will see this"

At first it is a little stiff to tighten the strap but it has gotten smother to tighten. Also in our truck we only have the seat clips on the outside passenger seats, in the back, and these straps are longer enabling you to have you child in the center of the back seat, using on mount from each seat.<br /><br />I love that it reclines and we will be able to use this until he gets big enough for the booster seat."

The Britax has much more padding and 3 slots for the crotch strap, compared to 2 on the Nautilus.  My son is much more comfy in the Britax.  It was a breeze to install in my Chevy Cobalt.  I was also able to get a 3 across with a RF Combi Coccoro and a RF Graco Myride(which I hate because of the buckle).  It is tight but doable. I installed it in less than 5 minutes and it is rock solid.  I love the no rethreading harness on it.  We are going to stick with Britax from now on!  We also have the Marathon in a spare vehicle.  The Britax are so easy to install and they also have so much more padding than the Graco.  I couldn't be more happier with my purchase.

0,3,0,0,0,,"We received this as a gift for our daughter before she was born.  It was bought with the intention that we cold use it instead of also buying an infant car seat.  After getting it out of the box and using my friends 2 month old to ""test"" (in the house) I realised it would NOT work for an infant! Even at nearly 9lbs our infant would not fit and it did not tilt far enough back to support her head and neck safely.  We ended up having to buy and infant seat as this was not supportive enough for an infant, she was to small to use it safely until around 5 months.<br /><br />We started using it at about 6 months in our additional vehicle and planned to use it as our main one when we transition out of her infant car seat.  At first I really liked it but I did struggle to get it tightened down properly.  Even my 6'3"" 200lb husband and 2 firefighters at our local car seat safety clinic couldn't get it to secure tight, it always moved more than 1 inch. We even tried a towel underneath (like the manual suggested) and pool noodle but nothing worked.  We were using the latch system not the lap or shoulder belt option, and have 2 Subaru's we tried it in (outback and impreza)<br /><br />Over the course of our first month using it full time I noticed the left seat belt clip (for baby) began to come undone if our daughter put enough pressure on it and became very hard to get to actually clip in.  The latch tethers keep getting more and more loose so we constantly had to re-tighten as much as we could but it never felt like it was tight enough. Also the fabric cover has begun to come undone, it doesn't want to stay on the side.<br /><br />On the plus side my daughter was comfortable with the fabric and padding, she never slept in her infant seat but slept better in this one. Personally I think she looks uncomfortable (her head always seemed forced forward to much) but she'll sleep in this one and NEVER did that in the infant.  I like the headrest and back support pillows it came with but they only fit right when she hit about 9mo.  Also for a convertible it's fairly lightweight and easy to carry if need be.<br /><br />My last straw with this one was a few weeks back when I turned the corner and the whole car seat shifted, almost slamming into the door because the latch tether had slipped AGAIN! I had to pull over and fix it! I was so tired of trying to tighten it down all the time and it slipping all around, this is one of the most important piece of baby equipment you should buy IMO! I didn't want to put my child's safety at risk anymore.  I took it out and bought the Britax Marathon 70-G3.  I LOVE the Britax so much and realise how unsafe this graco one was by not securing properly."
0,7,0,2,3,,"We just purchased this seat for our second child. We had the older version for our first child.  They have made several really nice improvements for this new model. The cover comes off easily and can be removed without taking the seat out of the car. The base is nicer - seems not to dig into the leather car seat as much and has latches for holding the attachment points if you wanted to travel with it and not have buckles and straps swinging around.  The fabric is plush but also seems to stay cleaner.  Overall, a nice improvement to an already great seat."

Not entirely sure if it will even fit in my 2001 Mercury Cougar because that vehicle has two scooped back seats and not much room without the front seats all the way forward. This seat does not recline unless you roll a thick towel and put it under the seat. My LO Loves to fall asleep during car rides and needs to recline back plenty. He tends to get a little fussy on longer car rides (over an hour and a half) but Im not sure if thats because the seat is uncomfortable or if its cause he wants to assert his independence and move around. The seat doesnt feel like its got a lot of padding and is probably uncomfortable on longer car rides. It works pretty good as a back up car seat for the price."
0,3,0,0,0,,"After reviewing lots of car seats, checking consumer reports and other sites, this seemed like a great fit. It’s a good price but highly rated for safety. Spending hundreds of dollars doesn’t ensure your child’s safety which isn’t how these products are marketed. It was simple to install and is easy to get a child in and out. As they grow, it has gotten harder to keep the straps tight, but I don’t know that that’s a flaw of the seat so much as a sign the child is close to needing a new seat or configuration."

Keeps her head in place while giving her comfort while leaving her room to move her head from side to side. Also love how easy it is to position the straps. Just have to move the head rest either up or down to get the straps in the correct place (right at her shoulders). This seat was over all easy to install. After looking at a bunch of different convertible car seats, I went with this one and I’m so glad I did! I love how it will grow with her and she won’t ever need another car seat after this one!

I am very picky and always do research before getting something and I would recommend this car seat to everyone I know. There are absolutely no cons to it and the best pro is that its one of the only car seats if not the only one that can rear face to 50 pounds!

2,3,0,0,2,,"It's okay. I definitely feel like my son is safe in this car seat. I love the extra room he has. He doesnt feel squished against the sides like in his infant seat.<br />  He is a big boy and at one year old he's the height and weight of a two year old, so we're on the biggest safety settings possible while still being rear facing. (we live in Washington and he can't be forward facing until the age of two, not matter his size)<br />  My only problems are; One- the seat itself is big. Almost to big for a rear facing. We have a small car and a minivan, and its fine in the van but it will not fit in the car. It will be fine once we can turn it forward facing, but for rear facing you need a ton of leg room to get this to fit right and be safe for baby. And Two- I almost feel like he's kind of hunched over a little when sitting in this seat. Not squished down because the straps are too low, but almost like the bottom of the seat is rounded so he can't sit up as straight as he should.<br />  That might fix itself when he switches to forward facing and the sitting angle is different. But for now it doesnt seem as comfortable as it could be.<br />  For the price and safety its worth the money"

If you have a regular car or even a compact suv this won’t fit rear facing , I have a Kia telluride it’s a medium size suv and it fits just right but also because we are not tall people 5.5 5.6 the tallest so there is the right room for the front seat , if you are taller I believe you’ll have your legs squished in order to properly position it. So FYI before you buy it , other than that I feel is the safest car seat that you can find."

2,4,0,0,1,,"The product should up in a flimsy cardboard box, smelling of mildew. There are no markings on the box other than a small sticker that appears to be applied by a 1 year old.<br /><br />The actual seat is dirty, covered in questionable dust and as I noted before smelling like mildew. The product states that it was manufactured 2 days prior to me ordering it and  the sticker that is on the seat with the date is applied very poorly. Typically it would be good news that I received the seat so early but something is off distribution chains are typically not that good. Some of the material looks like it is weathered and used. Raising questions as to where/ when<br /><br />The actual origins of this car seat are extremely questionable and and complete lack of quality control is very concerning. It’s hard to say whether the car seat was used and reconditioned or dragged around a warehouse with a test dummy in it.

4,4,1,1,2,,"My daughter was ready to move up from a carseat and I found this on here.  I was skeptical because of the low price, but I figured I would give it a try.  It came quickly and was very easy to assemble and put in the car.  My daughter loves it and it has done really well so far.  I would highly recommend it!"
1,4,0,0,3,,"I have one child and I have purchased six different car seats. We have had a Chicco Keyfit30 Infant Carrier, a Graco MyRide 65, a Safety 1st Complete Air 65, a Graco Nautilus, a Britax Frontier 85, and the Graco Smart Seat. I loved the Chicco, the MyRide, and the Britax. I loathed the Safety 1st and was lukewarm about the Nautilus. The Smart Seat is way better than the Safety 1st and the Nautilus. If my child was smaller and still rear-facing I would probably prefer the Smart Seat over the Frontier as well. The Smart Seat is great because it can really be the only seat you will need once you transition from an infant carrier. I love that the Smart Seat has a recline feature. Its very useful anytime my son falls asleep in the car. The seat is huge, but it fits in my Honda Civic without an issue (but again, I don't use it rear-facing). It is fairly easy to install and the built in lock off clip is really neat for a seat belt install if you need it. It is a pain to move this to other cars (like when Grandma takes the kid for the weekend), but part of that might be that I refuse to shell out another $100 for a second base for occasional use. There are some things I just plain don't like about this seat. The armrests are a joke. They move, but they don't really stay up. The up position on the armrests doesn't get them out of the way when you are trying to put the kid in the seat either. It is a pain to get my son in and out of this seat because it sits so high up and the armrests are always in the way. Its a little bit easier in cars with more headroom than the civic, but its still a pain. The crotch buckle can be difficult to release and there have been a couple of times that I thought I wasn't going to be able to get my kid out of the stupid thing. Overall, if you are transitioning from an infant seat, this is a great car seat to consider because its so versatile. I like the Smart Seat and my complaints may seem minor, but these are the things that keep me from loving this seat. If you have an older child that is already forward facing, look into the Britax Frontier 85 because it has a higher height/weight limit for the harness and higher limits as a booster without being as cumbersome."
4,4,0,1,0,,The Good:  My mini me loves his new booster seat. He can buckle himself in. I looks cool and from what I read safe.<br />The Bad : I bought a seat belt adjustment sleeve for his comfort and cool factor.<br />I would recommend this product : Yes

1,4,1,1,0,,"I do like how small and easy this is to travel with. With that said, one of the things I don't like, are the the side wings. They don't stay in a locked position so they quit often get in the way of unlocking the seat belt. Also, I don't like the hooks that hold the seat belt in place. They are difficult to maneuver around and if the side wings get pushed in, it makes it extremely difficult to get the seat belt unhooked. It took both my husband and myself to get my son unhooked half of the time. Very frustrating. I also worry about what would happen if there were an emergency and we needed to get my son out quickly. Not easy to get in and out of. My son also complained that the part of the seat that goes under his bottom was very uncomfortable."

This seat doesn't budge when I install it, very sturdy!<br /><br />The chest clip is designed to come apart when pulled on, to prevent bruising in the event of a crash. It's a safety feature unique to this seat. The clip's purpose on any seat is to achieve proper placement of the straps pre-crash; it doesn't have a purpose in an actual crash. Wish I had known this ahead of time. I thought the part was broken and called to order a new one."

If the weather is not good - you just want to get your child buckled as fast as you can and get out of the rain/heat/whatever.<br /><br />The feature that makes it easy is the one that allows you to loosen the straps before putting the child in.

1,5,1,0,3,,"I have downgraded this car seat for two reasons: First, the hooks for the LATCH system are poorly designed and very difficult to release. Second, the Owner's Manual is something that only a lawyer could love. On the positive side, the seat feels sturdy and seems safe, but I will leave that judgement to competent consumer testing labs.<br /><br />The attachment hooks for the LATCH system are question mark shaped, spring closing type devices. Attaching and releasing the hook from the rear anchor is not a problem since the rear LATCH anchor is visible and easy to reach. This is not the case with the seat level LATCH anchors which are hidden below the crease between the seat bottom and the seat back. Attaching the hooks to the lower LATCH anchors is a bit of guesswork and removing them is a total pain in the derriere. Since they are not visible and the spring takes some directional strength to remove, it is challenging to release them. I am a sixty plus year old grandparent and thought it might be me that couldn't make these hooks release easily. However, my son-in-law ( thirty years old; six foot five inches; 210 pounds) struggled for some time to remove the hooks. By contrast, we also have a Britax seat for a smaller child that has a push-button release for the seat level LATCH anchors. The release protrudes above the crease between the seat and back and so is easy to access and operate. This is much better design.<br /><br />If you are a parent and installing the seat for a long period of time, this may not be too big of a concern. If you are a grand parent or other relative who will be installing the seat for shorter periods of time as kids visit, I would recommend considering another car seat.<br /><br />The manual: Clearly written by a lawyer with a talent for obfuscation. It jumps back and forth between built-in harness/no built-in harness/back support/no back support/with LATCH/with car lap and shoulder belt. Vehicles built since 2002 have the LATCH system installed, but the LATCH instructions come last in each discussion of harness/no harness ....... - It is unnecessarily confusing. The installation with LATCH should be in a separate section at the first of the manual. Without LATCH should be after that and a note should be given at the first of the manual which section to read. Similarly, all with harness and without harness should be grouped. It's not that hard."

4,0,0,0,0,,"We purchased one of these for our daughter over a year ago and now our boy needed a car seat too so we went with the same type as they worked so well.  We took it out the box and put it in the living room and our little boy jumped in it straight away and within 20 mins was passed out and fast asleep.  He loves it, everytime we go out in the car he just settles down and relaxes.  He has plenty of room, can see out the windows and see everything that is going on and when he falls asleep, which he has done everytime so far, we can tip him back so he is more comfortable (although he is obviously more then happy even in the upright position).<br /><br />We have quite a small car, a Ford Focus Wagon, and now ahve one of thes on each side.  There is enough room in the middle for a small child or bags etc but not enough for a 3rd child seat but we don't need one yet.  I read some coments about certain parts not being very well made and I have to disagree, our daughters will be 2 years old this summer and has been put in and out of the car hundreds of times, it has been jumped on, bounced on, used a play toy in the house, dragged around the house, washed and everything and is still in perfect condition.  They are large but they are car seats, in our car there is not much leg room for anybody in the back so I expected that the kids would be able to reach the back of the seats and they do, I reconmend these to anyone who wants to have their children safe, secure and comfy and especially the ease for taking them in and out with the strap release is just another great feature, you can take the kids out after they have fallen asleep and just loosen the straps to get them out.  Plus the price is great for all the added function and features.<br /><br />If I ever need 3 car seats I will guarantee the 3rd one will be another one of these just in a different pattern again!!"

She does not complain about this car seat. The cup holder is streamlined and doesn't catch on legs and clothing like some other cup holders can. Installation was easy - there are separate latch belts for forward facing and rear facing for installation ease (no taking the whole thing apart to switch from rear to forward facing). Ours are forward facing, and are less bulky than other car seats; however, with a new baby coming, we chose an infant carrier, because this car seat rear facing would take up a lot of room. The straps are adjustable with a handle at the top (one of my must have features, because who wants to take apart the whole car seat because the straps don't fit right?!).

2,3,0,0,5,,We have a 2008 Toyota Yaris & a 2012 Toyota Carolla and needed to upgrade because our baby was an inch from outgrowing his other seat at only 9 months of age. We originally had a Baby Gear carrier seat which forced us to place it behind the passenger seat because the seat had to be moved up a lot. I did a search to find a carseat that would fit comfortably in our cars and this is the seat we found. My son can actually sit in the middle REAR facing in my husband's car & both him and any passenger has plenty of leg space (my husband is 5'11&#34;) and it fits perfectly behind the passenger seat of my Yaris with plenty of leg room for my friends that are over 6' tall. I was surprised we had so much more room compared to the carrier we were using. My son loves this seat and I would definitely recommend it. The straps are super easy to adjust with a lever at the top of the seat above the headrest which also adjusts the height as your child grows and the lever that adjusts the position of the seat is under the front of the seat.

0,3,4,0,0,,"I have twins, and this Graco convertible car seat came after our Chico infant seats. This Graco is a basic seat. It performs it's job well for the money, but it doesnt have much cushioning (it has removable pads that shift around and are a pain in the rear) and the seats rattle when I drive without my kids in the car. One of the twins puked all over the seat and we had to remove the cover to wash it. My husband had a difficult time getting the cover back on but I can say it did wash up nicely.  The covers are a light green and get dirty easily, but I do like the color when they are clean. The seats were easy to install. They easily adjust to several reclining positions. One really nice feature is the ability to adjust the straps to diiferent heights without having to take the whole seat apart. The red handle up top works quite easily to raise the straps as your child grows."
1,5,1,2,3,,"My daughter has been in this seat for several months now.  She absolutely loves it!!  She's tiny for her age so we waited until she was 5 to move her to a big booster like this.  She's now 6 and has enjoyed this seat very much.  She reports it's comfortable, cute, and she's able to buckle herself in on her own (even with a heavy winter coat on).<br /><br />The seat comes in several pieces, but assembly is super easy.  It took about 5 minutes (maybe less) to put it together.  Once it's constructed, all you do is put it in the car and run a shoulder seatbelt strap through the appropriate slot.  That's it!<br /><br />My daughter isn't much of a car sleeper, but she has fallen asleep in this seat a few times.  So it's possible.<br /><br />I highly recommend this booster.  It's easy to move, doesn't weigh a ton, it's easy to put together, and it's visually appealing to both kiddos and adults.  We'll be ordering a second one soon when my youngest is old enough."

Kid #2 just moved into this one and is much more comfortable than in the carrier carseat.<br /><br />This seat has a metal frame and is very solid from side to side, which makes me happy. Installation takes zero skill. The only drawback is that they are not small or slim - a bit too wide for airplane seats (you have to put the armrest up) and, when rear-facing, I have to slide the passenger seat forward slightly. An ok trade-off for me, though."

You can simply remove the insert once a baby outgrows it.  I like to protect the seat as much as possible, and I use a fabric guard just in case of milk spills or baby accidents.  My grandchild will soon outgrow it and we will use the Extend.<br /><br />Note!  Keep the booklet!  It is very helpful when making any adjustments.  The cup holders are helpful, but once in, they might be hard to put in again.  This is fine quality,  well-designed and of heavy construction and padding."

2,3,0,0,0,"Forward or Rear Facing Seat, Machine Washable Seat Pad, LATCH Compatible, No-Rethread Harness","I waited a year to write this review so I can really recommend this product and let me just tell you, I LOVE THIS CAR SEAT!<br /><br />When comparison shopping for a car seat my biggest issue with almost all other seats I looked into was size when used rear facing. I drive a Nissan Versa note (very small and compact) so having a car seat that I could use rear facing for as long as possible was the most important factor. This car seat, even when reclined all the way, still allows me to fit in my drivers seat. The only space issue is the width of the seat. If I install it in the center seat then there is almost no room on either side for another adult. When installed on either side it leaves enough room for one person to comfortably sit. It’s perfect for us because we are a family of three but definitely something to consider.<br /><br />The absolute game changer has been how comfortable this car seat has been for my child. I live in a city with heavy traffic and I also travel to a neighboring city which is two and a half hours away regularly and my daughter has not once had a meltdown in her car seat. Yes you read that right, in one year of use NOT ONE meltdown. She just turned two and is in the 70th percentile for height but still can comfortably ride rear facing.<br /><br />All in all this is a great car seat and I cannot believe I waited so long to buy it. The only regret I have is not going with the zipper version for easier washing but tbh it doesn’t make it or break it for me."

1,5,0,0,0,Washable FabricCup HolderWashable FabricCup Holder,"I have had nothing but Britax seats for my son and have always loved them.  I feel they are the safest and I won't buy anything else.  I specifically bought this seat because I wanted to use it as a booster at some point and it is the only one I know of that can be both latched and anchored.  While I still feel it is very safe, it is certainly a pain to deal with!  First, installation is far from easy.  You certainly don't want to be moving this thing around very often.  It's heavy and huge.  I didn't have many problems when I was using the 5 point system, but now that I have converted over to the seat belt/booster seat with my son, it is extremely annoying.  The belt gets stuck in the shoulder routing area each and every time he uses it. It gets twisted and mangled and my son cannot even buckle himself in because of this.  Now I have to strap him in every time.  I thought a booster seat was supposed to build a child's independence.  Instead, now I have to strap in my 6 year old every time he gets into the car.  Additionally, the belt will not retract when he unbuckles himself, again because it is stuck in the seat's shoulder routing area.  It just hangs twisted and loosely, often getting shut in the car door. After spending close to $300 on this seat, I really don't want to have to buy another one, nor do I want a less safe seat for him.  However, I'm far from happy about how this seat is functioning as a booster."

2,3,0,0,0,"Forward or Rear Facing Seat, Machine Washable Seat Pad, LATCH Compatible, No-Rethread Harness","I used the Chicco keyfit and loved it.  When Baby outgrew that, I bought the Britax Marathon for the sitter's car.  (She's a new driver and I wanted the highest-rated for safety)  I bought the Nextfit for my car based on the great reviews.  Plus, it is lighter weight than the Britax Marathon so I thought it would be food for air travel.  I have an advanced degree and watched several videos on YouTube but found this to be impossible to install rear facing with a seat belt.  It was clear after removing the crotch buckle cover that I was never going to get it threaded again.  I wrestled in the backseat of my Honda Accord for 45 minutes before I decided that this simply wasn't the car seat for me.  Removing the cover, which is required to thread the seat belt, further convinced me that this is not all that washable.  Plus, the fussiness of installation means it's not good for travel.  I mean, who's going to spend 45 minutes installing a car seat with the cab meter running?  Since it doesn't install quickly and is, therefore, not good for travel, I've decided to return it in favor of a second Britax Marathon.  I will say that that the fabric on the Nextfit was softer and more plush that then Britax.  So maybe it's better for car trips.  But in no way was this as easy to install as the Keyfit or the Britax . . . and since it isn't any cheaper or safer than Britax, that seems like the much better choice for our family."

The fabric is very nice, quality stitching. Chest straps are cushioned well and have sort of an anti-slip texture on the back side. That comes in super handy for us parents with those kids that love to adjust their own straps when they shouldn’t!<br /><br />It folds for travel, although you might rethink that because this thing is BEAST! It is heavy! I’ve lugged caresses through the airport before, but I’m not sure I’d recommend this one for travel.<br /><br />It also has a nice memory foam cushion in the seat.<br /><br />Now as far as using the seat, I don’t have much input on the infant or reverse stages. I used it for a few months in the forward facing five point harness stage. And currently using the high back booster. I felt comfortable with my daughter’s safety in both stages. It was just as easy to install as our chicco.<br /><br />Initially I was not a fan of the seat belt placement of the chest strap. On our other booster there is a plastic holder that you slide the belt into and with the Diono you just slide it beside the headrest. It just seemed a little awkward for placement, but it’s worked fine and I used to it now.<br /><br />I love the slim design. I always have two car seats in my vehicle and it can be difficult squeezing between them, when you need that third seat. I wish my other car seat was like this one! And even though it’s slimmer, my little still had plenty of seat room.<br /><br />It took my a second to figure out the cup holder! Just shove it in there and turn! Again another thing that initially threw me, but now it makes so much more sense!<br /><br />And with the 120 lb weight maximum, I don’t anticipate ever having to buy another car seat!<br /><br />Overall, I’m really impressed. This is definitely a car seat company I’ll be recommending in the future."

I originally purchased a different seat in a hurry due to a last minute overseas move and ended up hating it- the straps were difficult to adjust and was just overall bulky.  But not only is this one easy to install, it is also easy to adjust.  My son seems to be comfortable in it and when the day comes, we will purchase another one for his baby sister.  I also appreciate that it is much narrower than a lot of other car seats, but still has plenty of room for my son to be comfortable."
1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel","I admit that this is a cool concept, but the problem we had with it was our seven year old's rear was just too big for this seat.  He has just outgrown his Britax Frontier and though I knew this wouldn't be as wide as that, but I thought that it would give him a lift in the bucket seat without causing him discomfort despite it's small width.  My son sat on it for about four minutes before he said it was making his butt go numb.  For reference, my seven year old is 85 pounds and about 48 inches.  My five year old is a tiny guy and he fit well on this seat, but then we have the opposite problem for him -- at 48 pounds and 44 inches, it just doesn't seem safe to not have him in a full-back booster.  I'd say this seat has a very specific market.  I'm sure it's great for travel, but not totally practical for every day use for our family."

0,3,4,0,0,,"Purchased this for our second child - probably the tenth infant seat I've installed between us, our family, and helping out friends. It's fine for the kid - very good angle when rear-facing, quick to get the little one in and out.<br /><br />But I wouldn't recommend this to anyone - because it is extremely difficult to install. When installing in rear-facing mode, the vehicle seat belt is fished between the cushion and the frame - just like most other seats. However, the opening is extremely small. My hands aren't especially thick, but I can't get them into the opening. It takes a half-dozen attempts, squeezing my fingers through the tiny openings on both sides, hoping I can catch the seatbelt latch and pull it through without locking the shoulder belt. And the plastic around the inside of the openings isn't finished - just square cuts with very rough edges. I've lost skin on my hands all three times this seat has been installed.<br /><br />Always check out the seat belt openings at a store before you buy a car seat. If you can't get your hand comfortably through the opening - find a different seat. You never know when an emergency can cause you to move a safety seat - make sure you can do it quickly, comfortably, and without any confusion."

I bought one as a test seat for our 2 children who still need seatbelt adjustment. Our intention was to buy another if it worked for both kids as we have a smaller back seat and the space saving design was a huge bonus for us and their older brother who has been cramped by several booster seat trials. We have 2 very different sized children: a wirey boy, age 10, 4'4"", 65 lbs; and a tough as bricks girl, age 6, 3'4”, 70 lbs<br />What we determined:<br />This is a great seat for my small framed 10 year old. He loves that he is not in a little kid booster seat and I love that he is being protected. He also loves that he has more padding in the seat than his previous booster seat. Long rides were always a struggle as he begged to stop frequently to get a break from his previous seat.<br />However, our 6 year old, who is built differently, weighing more and with a wider hips, hated this seat. She complained that the plastic, adjustable sides pinched her and she really struggled with getting the seatbelt threaded correctly.<br />Overall, we are pleased with the purchase and will continue to use the Mifold for our son as long as we can."

This took me 3 minutes.  It was so fast i was thinking that i forgot to do something or missed s step, but the bubbles told me i was just fine.  My son is 8 months old and average weight and height and looks very cozy inside the car seat.  I the shoulder straps are kinda a pain in a butt, so far though he doesn't seem to mind.  Only issue is the tightening system.  I cant seem to get it as tight as I want it without making baby mad or myself!  It just wont tighten.  I have to play around a lil more and maybe it will get easier.  Otherwise the car seat is beautiful and so comfy it just feels so cushy, not like other ones I tested.  All my friends get the Britax but i didn't love the feeling of those ones.  We are going to NH this weekend (2+ hours) so this will be a test of how long the baby can tolerate the car ride.  I got the INFINITY color from BRUS.  ALso Im wondering if the recline at this point should always be set to '1'?"

The best thing of all to my mind is that the liner comes out really simply once the car seat is out of the car, it's also washable, and the strap that goes from the shoulder to the crotch is all one piece that the buckles thread onto so you can remove the whole thing, put the buckles in the dishwasher and the belt and cover in the washer and get it all clean.  The buckle that comes up from the crotch doesn't come out but it doesn't have the crevices that the other pieces do so it wipes down easily.

They were only moldy where they were inside the compartment, meaning that moisture is getting into that area without a way to circulate.  We have been to the beach many times and the pool, and along with normal spills, this has obviously been gathering for a year.  I am frustrated I need to dispose of an otherwise good seat and replace it because of a part I am not using that cannot be removed to be cleaned."
0,3,0,2,3,,"I have been a fan of Britax, due to their safety, quality and comfort.  This seat is a great value and works well for my 7 month old daughter.  I can see her growing into this seat easily.  I opted for the 55 pound, instead of going with a higher weigh model.  I figured by the time she is 55 pounds, she would prefer a high back booster with a seat belt, rather than a 5 point harness.  Note:  The car seat meets all of my expectations, though I wish the harness didn't need to be rethreaded in order to adjust-this is time consuming and while not difficult, definitely takes work."
4,4,0,1,0,,"I wanted to really love this booster seat.  I have a 5-year-old who is taller than over 99% of kids his age, so we cannot have him in a 5pt.  But I wanted something a bit more solid than the average booster seat.  I liked how this one attaches to the car (I think for convenience, I do not think it is practical in helping in an accident by the design).  It does not slide around when the kids are climbing in and out of the van.  It is a nice seat except the drawer does not slide and only makes my son frustrated.  We did not get any cup-holder.  And the BIGGEST problem, the only real reason I am leaving a less than 4 or 5 star review is that the part on the headrest that the seat belt feeds through does not fit the seat belt!  The seat belt must be crunched and folded to fit in, and then it is spit out by the booster every time my son gets unbuckled.  So we either have to feed it through every single time, and deal with the twisted belt, or not use it.  What is the point of a high-back booster if you cannot use that part?  I would have returned this except I did not keep the box because it never dawned on me we would have a problem with something as simple as a booster seat!  I have 5 children, and have been through countless car seats and booster seats over the last 12 years and this is the first time I have seen this!  Even the cheapie seats have a belt feeder that fits through them."

0,7,0,2,3,,"I got this seat just before we were to leave for our six hour car ride for Thanksgiving with the family. Our one year old daughter loved the seat and sang part of the way. Didn't fuss once. Even though her tummy was upset and threw up all over the place (chocolate milk). The seat cleaned very nicely and the straps were a tight enough weave that the vomit came right out -no smell. I only have one place for improvement, the handy velcro straps that hold the harness out of the way when you put baby in the seat are too low on the seat to do much good. They help so baby doesn't sit on the buckle but you still have to pull the buckles from behind their back.<br /> I love that it only took me about five minutes to install the seat and I was so comfortable with it that I didn't feel the need to go to the fire dept and have my installation checked. I got the mommy's helper seat shade for summer and it fits very nicely and easy to get on and fold back up."
0,5,0,0,3,Fits 3 Across,What is good about it is that it is narrow and you can fit it three across. It is also very sturdy and seems like it would hold up well in a crash. Of course that means that it is very heavy.  Install is harder than with other seats which is one reason why the NHTSB rates it very poorly for ease of use and is why Consumer Reports put it dead last in its category overall. The instructions are poor and installing front facing with the belts isn't easy because the belt path is so narrow that it scratches your hands to pieces. To install rear facing in anything but a very large vehicle you need to buy the optional angle adjuster or move your seats far forwards. The mechanism for tightening the harness also requires a lot of pulls. If it is loose it will take 20-30 pulls to tighten and takes far long than with other seats.

It is a little difficult to install as the width of the seatbelt/seat is more narrow than it should be, but it is still secure.

She has several health issues so it was important that I got her a car seat that was as easy as possible to navigate.  This car seat is perfect!  She has no trouble getting my daughter in and out of it.  It is much easier for her to lift her into the seat because the sides aren't raised - and the low profile design make it easier to grab the buckles from under my daughter as well.  The seat is very heavy, but you don't mess with it after it is installed so the weight isn't a big deal (assuming someone can install it).

I am petite, but found I had to literally put my knee in the seat to tighten the latch belt. It was difficult to tighten it - even my husband struggled.

1,3,0,0,0,Removable Seat Cushion,"It took awhile for our daughter and us to get used to this car seat.  Our daughter is small for her age (at 1 year she was only 17 lbs).  At this point the straps and chest plate fit but are on the big side - it's been 2 months and it is beginning to fit better finally.  I think she cried the first 2 weeks we used this car seat.  But we utilized her favorite blankie, nook, and mirror which really helped.  We recently took a 4+ hour drive and she rode like a champ.  I'm really looking forward to being able to turn her around.  LOVE that the straps tighten from the front, as our infant seat didn't and it was enough to make us hate that seat.<br /><br />Since she is so small the head rest does prevent her from seeing out the window but I think once she is bigger it won't be an issue.<br /><br />My husband installed the seat and he said it is pretty easy. We have a 2013 Subaru Outback and we have no issues with room.<br /><br />Overall we like the car seat.  I think it was hard because we expected an easy transition and it wasn't.

Here is why and I'll be brief because I'm doing this review from my phone as I look at the horrible red pressing marks on my 3 day old sons little thighs.<br /><br />I read the reviews after I bought this and installed it and got nervous after reading so many reviews about how tight and uncomfortable this is for the baby but they are all correct.<br /><br />First the tech at the hospital that walked with us outside to put our baby in the car when my wife was released immediately saw the seat and said ""oh boy, you guys will be returning this, this seat hurts babies""!  It took the tech about 10 minutes to get our baby in.  He cried for a bit then stopped so we figured the seat was fine.  This AM we had a docs appointment and it was time for us to put him in the seat.  Our baby is 8.0lbs, 19 inches and I pretty much had to smoosh and stuff our little babies legs and arms into the harness.  He cried louder than ever and the straps dug into his thighs creating these horrible red marks that im looking at now.  We tried to get him in the seat as perfect as possible so we are positive the seat and harness are just to small.<br /><br />The seat looks great and the Quinny stroller also looks great but I'm taking this thing back today.  I'm 6'1 and 260lbs, so I'm not a small guy but this car seat is heavy, 10+ lbs for the seat and almost 20+ lbs all together with baby.  My wife is 5'4 and 115lbs so I think she may have some issues moving this in and out of the SUV on her own.<br /><br />Also...anyone that says this car seat fits their baby great and is lightweight is obvoisuly either being paid by the company to write a fake review or doesn't have the straps on the baby.<br /><br />Remember, our baby is under 9 lbs and barley fits into this seat and the company says it fits up to 30 lbs, yeah RIGHT!<br /><br />AVOID this seat if your babies comfort is important.

1,3,3,2,3,,"The seat itself in use is just fine, but wow the installation was a pain. I read so many reviews about it being simple but ended up spending way too much time on a hot July day getting increasingly frustrated by the minute having to take things apart and readjust in several areas. A few tips in case you find yourself in my position--We are moving to this seat with a one-year-old who is clocks in at 31&#34; tall. The seat clearly comes set up and ready to go for the smallest babies, so before you go to the hassle of installing this thing, if you are putting in a larger baby, remove the infant cushions, lengthen the harness straps and move the buckle between the legs to the outer slot. I made the mistake of installing as is and even with the harness straps extended as far as they would go, my daughter just started screaming immediately because her thighs were being pinched terribly. If you use the latch installation, I found the button to release the strap almost impossible to unlock. It has to be a glitch in ours, but I spent several minutes battling this thing just trying to push the button to loosen the dang strap (also I learned that if you over-tighten the latch straps, the clicktight will not click. So, trying to loosen the thing back up to get this thing just to close became my nightmare). Without easily loosening the strap, it's also nearly impossible to remove the clips from the latch bars. I may try to the seatbelt method next time we remove it because that's what other reviewers seem to be finding so simple. Anyway, when all is said and done my daughter seems to be comfy in it, I'm just dreading the next time we need to take it out of the car."

My son is one and a half years old an I have to say after reading the reviews and deciding to try this one I'm a little disappointed, for starters I adjusted the harness and they don't really seem to stay over his shoulders and fall off his arms, I think this seat is more suitable for bigger kids 2 plus. The other thing is the seatbelt latch is a little finicky because you have to put the 2 halves together before you can insert them, it can be a small hassle at night, the Recaro seat you only have to click one side in at a time. If you are looking for a car you thats easy to put in and take out this one is not it, but luckily the grandparents don't drive much or have a need to remove it. Overall the quality seems good and it's soft and padded as well as easy to clean, so if you don't have to remove it often and don't mind the latch then I say try it otherwise try looking at the Recaro, it uses the latch system that's installed in most newer vehicles just 3 hooks to latch on, where the Britax uses the vehicles seat belt that you have to maze around through the seat."

Easy to use...makes traveling SO much easier...we left the stroller at home and just used the car seat as our stroller through the airport. EVERYONE stopped us and asked where we got it! WAS FANTASTIC! The car seat you use has to have the ""latch"" system to hook into it - most car seats now a days have that so not a big deal = We used a cheap car seat that we bought at Walmart for traveling - keeping our fancy one in the car...If you travel a lot I recommend that too... just makes for easier transfering....SERIOUSLY if you dont absolutely HAVE to have a stroller where you are going to - leave it at home and use this!

0,7,0,2,3,-1-1,"I've looked at tons of seats, compared consumer reports, read reviews and this is by far the best one I've found.  It just seems stable and looks comfortable for the baby.  My son sleeps in it just as easily as he did his KeyFit 30 (which we absolutely loved).  We bought a Costco seat first and quickly returned it because it was so lightweight, had zero padding, and moved all over the place even with towels propping it up (yes towels... ugh).  This seat is fairly easy to install and it doesn't really shift when jostled.  The only thing we found slightly annoying is that it has a back tether and neither of our cars have a hook on the floor for rear facing mode."

Also took me maybe 5mins to put it in the car and about the sams to adjust the straps, and clip for his size.<br /><br />Also if you want to set it. Go to walmarylt or target and have your kid sit in one. Its amazing and honestly worth the price!"

It's just as safe/secure as my expensive one and light enough to travel thru busy airports, handing on my stroller. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is b/c the brand needs to offer more colors.

0,3,3,2,3,,"I do not trust Britax.  I think they have a liability problem on their hands. Here's why:<br /><br />1) I have the 2015 model, which was recalled to replace a cheap red button that is supposed to allow you to release the straps (the 2014 also had a previous bulletin where some models manufactured earlier in the year came without the straps properly attached to the actual seat---and parents had no idea because it was hidden).  The solution for my red button issue was a mailed packet of grease (no joke!).  Now I have a greasy button that still does not function properly.  In fact, it might be worse because, despite wiping it down as instructed, sand and cheerios crumbs get stuck to it. I asked if the 2015 model was any different and they said they only fixed the red button (I am not so sure---and if you read other reviews on here and NHTSA---you will see I am not alone).<br /><br />2) The straps are ALWAYS uneven (which may still be related to the red button) and I can't get them to the point where they are even, so one shoulder is always loose, the other too tight.  I have called Britax on 3-4 occasions and when I actually get a human, they seem to deny this is an issue and give me all sorts of steps to go through with the straps to make sure they are not caught somewhere. I do everything and the problems remain. I never fail to get pushback as if I must be doing something wrong (4 different times).<br /><br />3)  This barely fits my son at 21 months.  Again, you will read other reviews about Britax Clicktights and see the myriad of complaints about false promises of this seat being appropriate to the lengths/weights provided.  I have also asked Britax about this issue and am met with denial (again, when I actually get a human). A car seat inspector told me she approached Britax at a convention (when it was in Chicago, I believe) about this issue of making seats too small for the children for whom they claim they are made.<br /><br />4) There is now a recommendation to not use the tether in the rear facing position (or not) in my model.  I say the &#34;or not&#34; because the last I looked, the updated PDF manual says not use the strap, but another document said it was ok. When I called and got a human, I pointed out the discrepancy and she basically told me she thought it was ok to use but she sounded really, really unsure.  Now I'm really confident (sarcasm implied).<br /><br />The only positive I can say is that this does install quite easily (if you can overlook the weight and bulk)....but can I really trust it given everything else?<br /><br />I held off for a long time in complaining about this product in a public forum or to the government, but I've had enough.  I guess they need to be hit by the only thing they care about: $$$, whether through the loss of sales, government intervention, or a terrible accident that leads to a liability claim.  I was spurred today by not getting any response from Britax again (a fun 10-15 minute circle through the phone tree) and by seeing others make the effort to report these same issues to NHTSA when I researched it after no one would take my call. If you also have a complaint about this seat, file a complaint with NHTSA and call them (you will noticed the Advocate Clicktight is listed twice so the complaints are broken up).  Britax won't listen so I will make sure someone will. I try to address my consumer problems by giving companies multiple chances to address things outside of the public eye, but I can only take so much when it comes to my son's safety."

2,7,4,0,3,,"Overall the seat is great. Easy to install. I was fairly disappointed with the new Click Snug Harness system. For one, it seems like the straps themselves don't expand to a long enough length. It can be difficult to get my 31 pound, 32 month old son's arms under the straps when he's wearing his winter coat. Yes, I know, I'm supposed to take his coat off. Just saying that compared with my other Britax seat, I have no problem getting his arms in and out with his coat on.<br /><br />Also, it seems that the harness clicks to tell you it's snug when it's not as snug as I feel it should be. Again, perhaps this is due to the extra thickness that occurs due to cold weather clothing."
2,3,0,0,3,,"We purchased this seat because it is supposed to be the best convertible seat for extended rear facing- we like to keep our kids in the reverse position until age 5, ideally. It will be a few years before I can report on that but so far our little guy loves his seat and he definitely has room to grow. The installation was easy and it has stayed very secure in the months since. The only complaint that I have- and it is minor, not even worth removing a star- is that I wish there was something to keep the lap buckles from falling all the way to the bottom of the straps. I have to dig them out from underneath the baby EVERY time!"

1,5,4,0,2,,"So far, this is an excellent car seat.  After reading some of the negative posts, I was leary of the tight straps and near impossible latch system.  I bought strap covers with the purchase of this car seat and eliminated the first issue right off the bat.  I, however, think the latch system is great.  With my previous car seats, I have had to get my husband to install and uninstall the seat because I didn't have the strength to do it by myself.  There isn't a &#34;button&#34; to push to loosen the straps, but all you have to do is flip the hard plastic piece away from the strap and it loosens enough to unlatch it.  I have successfully installed and uninstalled this seat 3 times in the last week alone.  I also love how easy it is to loosen and tighten the harness straps, and the cup holders are an added bonus. I am in need to two car seats, but only purchased one initially to make sure I liked it.  I will definitely get a second of this same model!"

2,3,0,0,2,,The seat itself is great however installing it for the rear facing position is very difficult. I have leather seats and the bottom of the seat is heavy plastic and tends to slide around making it hard to get the seat into the proper position so you can thread the seat belts through the holes for them. It could use some kind of rubber strips on the bottom. The cup holders are great my grandson loves having a spot for a cup and one for his snacks. The leg room issue is due to the fact that he still has to ride rear facing I’m sure that won’t be an issue when we can switch it to front facing.<br />The strap that the harness attaches to could be a little longer it is hard to get a hold of after you put your child in the seat.<br />Overall I like the seat and am happy with it.

We have since used it on an additional trip to Europe, as well as when using car share services and can't bring our larger car seat. It works great for our 5 year old and is very easy to inflate and install in the car. The one minor annoyance is that the air valve doesn't prevent air to flow out, which means it can be tricky to close the valve while avoiding too much air to flow back out.<br /><br />During our second Europe trip we got a puncture wound on the car seat bladder.

1,4,1,0,3,,"Our first priority was safety and after researching this product and talking with people that already had this model, we bought it.  The cup holders are nice but we still have sippy-cups with handels so obviously they dont go in easily.  Maybe future models could have cup holders with 2 slots for handels, but that is very small.  Our daughter always falls asleep no matter how fussy she is going into the car.  So that must be a good sign of its comfort.  She currently is only 24 pounds and is very petite so she looks a little small in this big chair, but she loves it.  Its nice having the little storage compartments inside the arm rests so some of her toys can be hidden inside and she can easily access them to her liking.  The connections are ok.  There is a learning curve to efficiently getting her buckled up, but you dont want buckles that are too easy to lock and unlock because kids get smart and you wouldn't want them getting out. Great design over-all."

It is a no frills seat, but that also makes it very easy to use. The cover is really cute, but the padding is a bit thin.  I would not use this as my primary car seat for that reason alone.

Thanks to all the positive reviews, I bought this home last night from a store that carries the pink and grey color that me and my DD prefers.  If only Amazon had this color, I'd definitely pass up on paying extra 7% tax to the store.  Installation is a breeze!  Latch hooks are the easiest to install and when I tighten them up, they stay put, tried to tug and pull on it, it won't budge! I don't need to fasten the seat to the car each time. And the seatbelt stays in the belt positioning loop. Love it, love it!  This is my first time buying booster seat, and I think I made the right purchase. I was torn between getting the Turbobooster and this one, but the latch and the extra body and head rest circumference was worth the extra $30 for my own piece of mind.  I highly recommend this one, for a booster seat with latch at this great price?  And most importantly my DD loves it, too!"
0,3,0,2,0,,"I researched A LOT of car seats before I finally decided to buy this one, and I'M GLAD I DID.  First, here's some information about the seat:<br />In the rear-facing position, this seat holds infants from 5 - 40 pounds AND the top of their head must be at least 1"" below the top of the seat back.<br />In the forward-facing position, this seat holds toddlers from 20 - 65 pounds AND less than 50"" tall.<br />FYI, children need to be in a car seat/booster seat until they are 4'9"" tall (57"") OR age 8, and the average 8 year old boy, according to growth charts, is 50"" tall.  So if I understand this correctly, that means that if your child just turns 8 years old, and they're 50"" or less, than they don't need a car seat anymore.  So if that's the case with my child, this could be the last car seat he'll ever need.  But if he's above average height, he'll outgrow this seat if he gets to 50"" tall before his 8th birthday.<br />I did not have this car seat with a newborn.  We were using a Graco Snugride 35 infant car seat.  I had to push the passenger seat forward about halfway to get the car seat to fit in my 2006 Honda Civic.  With this convertible car seat rear-facing, I have a couple more inches for the passenger seat to be pushed back, which is very nice for me (5'9"" tall) and my husband (6'1"" tall).  Both of us can now sit in the passenger seat much more comfortably.  The seat can't be pushed all the way back, but it can most of the way.  I plan on keeping him rear-facing as long as possible to keep him safe, so I'm really glad this car seat goes all the way up to 40 pounds rear-facing, which is a little hard to find in a car seat.  And even harder to find in a car seat with that weight max for this price.  All the other ones are 100 dollars more.<br />We just got this car seat when my son turned 9 months old.  He's about 21 pounds and about 30"" tall, so right around average for his age.  His infant car seat was getting too small for him, and especially too heavy to carry.  He fits great in this seat now.  He looks very comfortable.  PLENTY of room to grow...he's got about a foot of room to grow up the seat back.  This car seat is very well padded, nice head rest cushioning (not quite as much cushioning as his infant car seat, but he doesn't need as much now that he's not a newborn anymore), plenty of room in the crotch area, and the buckles are very solid.<br />The seat is up pretty high so he can look out the window, which is nice.  I would say it's up just as high as his infant car seat was.  So I still have to be careful getting him in and out so I don't bump his head on the door frame.  Probably won't be an issue once he's forward-facing.<br />The cup holder is laughable.  I didn't want him drinking when he's in the car anyway in case he chokes or spills everywhere, so I just didn't put it on the car seat.<br />I like how the the height of the harness can be adjusted just by sliding it up and down.  I don't have to take the whole seat apart to re-thread it as my child grows like I had to do with his infant car seat.<br />Installation I thought wasn't too difficult.  I was confused a couple times, but I figured it out.  It took maybe 30 minutes to install on my own.  I wish the straps came ready for rear-facing.  Part of the instructions were to take the seat cover off to get to the straps underneath if you need the seat in rear-facing position.  Just be sure to put the seat cover back on before you attach the seat to your car.  which I assumed and did do, but I read another reviewer say they had an issue with that).  And I did have to put a towel under the car seat to get the correct angle.<br />I love how the loosening/tightening lever is designed, though it's a little hard to get to the lever on the side to tighten and loosen the straps.  In our car, our backseat cushion is in the way a little.  The tightening and loosening lever is on both sides of the car seat though, so I usually just reach to the other side and use that lever instead, which I don't really mind.<br />I read another recent review of this car seat, and I just wanted to say that I think the chest buckle and shoulder straps work great.  The chest buckle looks like it's built very solid and the shoulder straps lay right where they should on my child's shoulders.<br />So overall, I'm extremely happy with this car seat.  Only a couple very minor cons, which I wouldn't even really consider as cons, so I absolutely give this car seat 5 enthusiastic stars!!!"

1,4,1,0,3,,"We are very disappointed with the Graco Nautilus 3-in-1. I am particularly disappointed in the false presentation of this carseat by Graco. My husband and I have agreed we will hesitate before buying a Graco product again.<br /><br />We have a 3 1/2 year old boy who is 35 lbs and average height. He is much too small for a booster and we wanted a good seat that would keep him in the five point harness as long as possible for safety. Statements like ""The Nautilus features an extended five-point harness design that can accommodate children over the age of one, from 20 to 65 pounds in weight"", ""Forward-facing car seat can accommodate children up to 65 pounds."" and ""Its five-point harness accommodates children up to 65 pounds"" convinced us to buy what seemed like a good affordable carseat. And it IS a beautiful carseat.<br /><br />But the statement in the instruction manual that if the crotch strap is under your child then you need to change to the booster made us send it back! Our son is not large, he is very average to a little small in size and he was sitting directly on top of the crotch strap when the strap was in the furthest position. Not only would this be uncomfortable and unsafe, the manual says not to use the carseat this way. So we were faced with placing a 35 lb child in a booster seat! No Way!!<br /><br />We shipped it back immediately (at a cost of $20) and bought the Apex 65 which he fits in very nicely with room to grow.<br /><br />Graco either needs to add a third slot for the crotch strap to this carseat or change their advertising because their current wording is very tricky, bordering on false!"

And it's so light!  And super soft!  Other competitors backing is just a hard surface with a very thin foam pad for the child's back.  Britax's backing is very plush and comfortable.  I'm 100% sold on this design.  Comparing the different brands in the store was hard, but friends said to go with Britax so we did.

0,3,0,0,2,,"We ordered this carseat to replace our infant carrier for our 7-month-old daughter. It arrived promptly and in good condition. It was not difficult to install in the car (we didn't need to use a towel for rear-facing as another reviewer did). My husband did need my help in getting the latch hooks fastened as tight as possible; I had to kneel on the seat while he pulled the strap taut. The owners manual is a bit confusing (as other reviewers have noted). We have not had issues with the release button being difficult like some did; I think the main reason we haven't had issues is that our infant carrier had a similar button that I think required even more force to release.  It has a good amount of cushion for the longer trips we have to make to see the grandparents. Our daughter has slowly gotten used to this seat as opposed to the carrier, and I think her biggest issue is that if she loses a toy, it's gone until we can stop to give it back to her as she was used to having toys on the carrier handle. The straps do keep her from moving forward to reach something she's dropped - which they're supposed to.  The price for this seat was unbeatable, and I'm sure our daughter will like it a whole lot more when we turn it around when she turns a year old. We did purchase some strap covers as some of the reviews of this seat mentioned chafing, so we haven't had any issues like that either.  Overall, we're glad we purchased this carseat, and we would recommend it others looking (as long as they're looking for a girl)."

We haven't tried installing with the seat belt yet, so I can't say how easy that is, but it doesn't seem complicated. It is very simple, light weight and perfect for travel. I was shocked at how light the box was when delivered! This seat is great because our daughter is small and needs a 5pt harness right now and she is in the smallest setting. This will grow with her for many years to come. We will use this as a second seat for my husbands smaller car and for travel. Great for small cars, but the padding isn't as thick and comfortable as her daily seat, but then again that seat is much heavier! Highly recommend as a backup, secondary for grandparents or for traveling with young ones. No regrets here."

2,3,0,0,3,,"I was originally going to give this product a bad review because when I first installed it the bottom latch straps seemed too short to allow it to recline in the furthest forward facing recline position.  I had purchased it specifically for it's reclining ability because my son had been using a Britax marathon, but every time he fell asleep his head would fall completely forward and he would constantly waken from his air being cut off (his head would end up falling 2 or 3 inches off the back of the seat). So I got the Graco extend2fit for the recline feature, but due to the short straps the base was brought close to the back of the seat not allowing the back of the carseat to recline much, . But when I called Graco customer service to see if they could send me a longer strap, it turns out that I was trying to latch the straps from the rear facing strap pass-through. Before installing this seat forward facing, you must reach under the seat pad and slide the strap up to the 2nd seat belt pass-through located more near the back of the seat. This will bring the straps closer to the car's latch system and allow the seat to recline properly. Now the seat's angle is very reclined and I am positive that when my son falls asleep he will rest comfortable, as it would be a physically impossibility for his head to drop forward from that reclined position.<br /><br />as far as installation, the seat is standard installation other than having to move the latch strap which was slightly tedious.<br /><br />pros:<br />seat padding is very high quality and comfortable<br />removable seat pad should absorb most spills or accidents for easy removal and washing<br />love the option to thread through an extra head rest cushion<br />love the recline settings<br />love that it has cup holders as his britax did not. just put them in place then gave them a quick sharp pop with my fist to lock into place. (cup holder installation took less than 10 seconds. seriously. Don't know what other people were complaining about.)<br />5 point harness adjusts height with the headrest. very east to slide up and down. no re-threading shoulder straps.

Although the seat still works fine, this particular gray material (called Galaxy I think) started pulling fairly early on and has gotten worse over time so the seat looks pretty beat up at this point and I'm a little concerned it may start ripping in the future.  As I mentioned, the seat still works fine and I'd continue to recommend it but not so much with this particular color/material.  The orange seat still looks great after years of use and abuse."
0,4,0,0,5,,My daughter used to scream and be inconsolable when in the car even for a few minutes. Basically from birth until 10 months. We had a newborn to toddler convertible car seat. She loves this car seat. Only cries when she’s tired or hungry in it. It is very cushiony and much more open. She doesn’t like to be strapped in usually but this car seat doesn’t bother her usually. It has a leveler to make sure she’s in the right position for her safety. The only part I don’t like if the easy the latches for the car. They are really easy to remove with one button release. The problem is that my car seat hooks are under the seat cushion and it a little bulky to get clipped in. Otherwise I’d still recommend to anyone. We actually were recommended this specific car seat by a friend because their daughter love it too.

Many of them have babies. My daughter is 2 and average size, but she has already begun to complain about it hurting. I can't imagine being able to use this seat a lot longer and we really want it to last longer than a year. This is a seriously terrible piece of engineering. Britax has received an incredible amount of complaints here and have done nothing to apologize or fix the problem. They continue to sell the seat. So I want to like it. But I seriously recommend you do not buy this seat if you plan to use it in a non-anorexic child over 3."

When I turned her around forward facing I couldn't seem to get the back to tighten to where it wasn't sliding back and forth so I would use the cars seatbelts to secure it tightly. After having to take the carseat out to clean it I just happened to read in the manual that when you switch the carseat from rear to forward facing, the latch system actually gets moved to a different spot(I didn't even think about this when I first switched it as that's never been something I've haf to do with any other carseat). So after moving the latch system and reinstalling the carseat, it fits nice and snug with back and forth movement. Hopefully some of the other reviews I've read where they had the same problem will read this and maybe that I'd their problem too"
2,4,0,0,1,,Hope you are a car seat expert if you buy this model. The instruction booklet contains pictures only that do not explain installation or adjustment well at all and the installation videos online are just as helpful. Thankfully there was someone at the hospital who had the exact model and was able to help us adjust and install or we would have had to go to the store to buy a different one. Definitely do not recommend for newborns or any rear facing infant size. Seems like it will be good for forward  facing sizes.

Now you have a way to move your carseat AND your kiddo around with your suitcase, so you can carry his seat all the way to the gate. My son loved it! It was also great to have is carseat around when were just sitting around waiting at the airport, he's sit in his carseat(something familiar) and take a nap. I did the bags, I did the wheel not for me and a curious toddler. This is so simple not to mention cost effective!

The booster is nicely padded and makes him feel secure. The arm rests are a plus because he knows to put his belt under em, but there aren't too low/high to use if he'd like. I love that the cup holders are more built in vs the harnesses booster (also pictured) cup holders. It is more narrow and added about 4 inches to the open space in our backseat (compared to the harnesses seats sitting side by side). We bought 2, one for each of our cars.

0,4,0,0,0,,"I wanted a booster seat for my rather large 3 year old that still offered 5-point restraint.  Indeed this unit has it, but there are not enough adjustment slots for the crotch strap for growth.  Will have to go to lap belt sooner than I prefer.  Additionally, this uses the cheap, very thin straps that twist and frustrate.  The release button is very hard to press, which might be ok (even preferred by some), but no for me.  The plastic strap guides pop out of the fabric too readily.  Good features are comfort for kid, price.  If you are coming from a Britax, you will likely be disappointed.  I am also somewhat concerned that the stellar reviews for this product, and the seemingly negative votes for bad reviews are questionable."
1,4,4,2,3,Adjustable,"Previously we had traveled with our Britax Boulevard G3 on a $25 folding hand truck, attached with a GoGoBabyz ratchet strap.  That system worked well, although we never had our son ride in the seat and the base hung over the tow plate quite a bit.<br /><br />For my most recent trip I anticipated having my 2 year-old ride in the newer, Clicktight seat in the airport, so I decided to spring for the Britax-specific cart.  Although for the G3 or G4 models, the LATCH attachments would be a great advantage, the lower anchor connectors on the Clicktight models are suboptimal, so it took a few tries to get the right configuration.  Ultimately, I used the lower anchor strap to install the seat on the cart in the same manner you are instructed to install the seat on the airplane.  That is, through the forward-facing belt path but NOT under the Clicktight panel.  For this purpose, I could have easily used that old ratchet strap, tightened more easily, and avoided the hassle of the lower anchor strap altogether.  In fact, with the higher anchor point of the ratchet strap, the installation probably would have been more secure.  As it was, my son was able to ride in the seat.<br /><br />The cart does not lock open.  It is reasonably lightweight and fit into the overhead compartment easily. As far as rolling it down the aisle, that would be completely car-seat dependent.  The Boulevard Clicktight did barely fit down the aisle of an A320.<br /><br />tl;dr version.  When using a Clicktight convertible, the only advantage of this cart over a $25 hand truck is the longer tow plate."

0,7,0,0,5,Adjustable Head SupportCup Holder,"This is my third Safety 1st Complete Air 65 purchase. I have over 2 years of experience with these car seats, and can say with certainty that I am a loyal Safety 1st Complete Air 65 fan.<br />About 6 months after buying my first seat (Decatur color), I was in a car accident with my 1.5 year old son in the back. Thanks to this seat, my son was left unmarked and tightly secured. After this incident, I went on to buy 2 more of the exact same seats, 1 as a replacement for my eldest son (as it is required to replace the seats after a high impact car wreck) and then went on to purchase this specific model (Seabreeze color) for my youngest son.<br />First and foremost, safety is always most important when considering a car seat purchase, and because of my personal experience of being in a car accident while putting this seat to use, I am very confident in the safety of this seat. So confident that they are the only seats I trust to protect my boys. Once you get the safety of the seat aside, it's refreshing to see how aesthetically appealing these seats are! The Seabreeze color pattern is very modern and mellow and is definitely not sore on the eyes. The seat covers are removable and washable, which definitely comes in handy when you have kids who eat or spill drinks while in their seat! The material is very plush and comfortable (almost sponge-like), so I was worried that cleaning it would be difficult. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that after being washed and reassembled, the car seat literally looked like it was brand new, fresh out the box.<br />The head rest is an excellent feature to help ensure the safety of your most precious cargo. It is easily adjustable (as are the body straps) for your growing tot. It is also nice that there is a detachable cup holder for the side of the seat which really has come in handy for my son to stick his sippy in when he's tired of holding it.<br />The seat itself is quite light, I am 130 lbs with not much upper body strength, so having a seat that I can install without overexerting myself was very important to me, and this seat definitely fit the bill.<br />This seat will definitely be a great one to grow with your child. My son began using it shortly after his 1st birthday; he is now 3 and this seat still works wonderfully for him. My single complaint is that the chest straps sometimes easily get turned/tangled up, but this is something that is easy to correct. If that is the worst flaw that can be found with this seat, I'm quite alright with that! If I ever decide to have another child, I would definitely buy another one of these seats without a hesitation."

But if you want to extend it to make more leg room you will probably have to move the front seat up that the car seat is behind. Which can make a front passenger be really short on leg room.

I have heard too many horror stories about car rental companies that have dirty seats that are expired, may or may not have been in accidents, or no seats at all to risk it. This rolls up very well. My five year old is unable to buckle/unbuckle himself even after a week of regular use, but that's because the straps that hold it are tight (which I consider to be a good thing). He also didn't fuss about going back into his regular 5 point harness when we got home, which is another plus.

1,4,1,0,3,,"After two weeks of research using [...] and Amazon, I stumbled across the Nautilus in another person's review. After trying out a couple of car seats in store we decided to buy the Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 for our 5 yr (38 lbs, 42in) daughter. She is too tall for her Cosco Alpha Omega, but I did not feel good about putting her in a booster because she is under 40 lbs. Plus, the new recommendations are that kids should remain in 5 pt harness seat for as long as possible. I was considering the Britax Regent (Britax's website has excellent info on exact measurments of their seats) The hightest strap placement on the market-but is way too big to fit comfortably in my Ford Escape, no cup holder or booster option, and daughter said not comfortable. The SafeGuard Go (the second highest strap placement but top tether is required for install), two of my friends have this seat and love it. I liked compactness and portability, but really wanted a bit more padding and recline option. The Britax Frontier sounds good, but no stores have it yet and the Nautilus is very similar for almost half the price. What I like about the Nautilus is that it's well padded and reinforced with steel. My daughter is in the next to highest strap setting, so I'm hoping I can get two years out of the harness option. In any case she will be well over 40 pds by the time she grows out of the harness and will be able to use it as a booster. I like the cup holder (while this may seem like a small thing there have been several fights in my car about cup holders between my girls) it's part of the seat so it doesn't stick out and seems deep enough to prevent tipping, it also has two nifty cubbies on the inside of the chair. I'm hoping they won't be major dirt collectors, but daughter likes them for her little toys. It is very easy to loosen and tighten straps unlike the Alpha Omega where I really had to tug and still wasn't satified with tightness. I put it together and installed in about 1/2 hour and that included reading the manual. Moving the straps up or down is not complicated, but it does need to be removed from car to do. It has a recline option, but I have to say it is very negligible, like 5% at most. My daughter does not sleep in the car and no other seat of this nature has that option that I've found. We take a very long car trip every summer and I am concerned she will not be able to sleep through the night. I may get some kind of travel pillow. I would think for a younger child who still naps this might be a problem. I had no problems installing using latch & tether, it is nice and tight. (again read manual b/c once child is over 40-48 lbs you need to use seatbelt to install which would probably add time to install. I think the Nautilus is a great option for keeping your precious cargo safe and secure for a very good price. This is the 8th carseat I've purchased between my two kids, grandma and aunties' car and feel I have quite a bit of expierience when it comes to different features. Do your research and decide what features YOU need. All car seats have to meet minimum standards and correct usage and installation is the most important part. Know your child's height/weight and limitations of the seat. Most kids grow too tall for a seat before they reach the weight limits. If you are looking for a harness option for your older child I think this is a great seat!!"

1,4,1,0,3,,"We bought this seat for our 1 year old who seemed quite ready to face forward.  He love it so far!  We have been using the seat for about 3 weeks and it seems to fit him well and he seems to be comfortable in it.  The cup holder is handy for both a toy and sippy cup.  The fire dept seemed to think that it was a little tricky to install, but they did it.  We just left the head rest off for now, as he is still pretty small in the seat.  I am excited that this is the only seat we will have to get for him until he rides with out one!  It is very affordable for its long usage, and there are coupons out there at babies r us etc that can be used towards discounting the price further!"
0,3,0,2,1,,"it's pretty narrow, which is a huge plus, because we have two of these (one pink and one gray) and a booster seat bench in the back seat of our toyota rav4.  if it were not for its narrow size, we would not be able to fit all three of our kids in the backseat."

1,3,4,2,0,Removable Seat Cushion,"Just received this seat to move our 7 month old into the next level of car seat, mainly because she was getting too heavy for me to carry her around in her infant bucket seat. This car seat is sturdy, fits in my Honda Accord easily, and was super easy to install. She has no complaints about being in the seat and it's pretty easy to buckle her in and out. I will say there is velcro on the sides which I thought would be super handy to keep the straps out of the way when putting her in the seat, but the velcro patch on the straps doesn't line up to the patch on the side of the seat so we can't utilize that feature. Oh well, good thought."

4,4,0,1,0,,"These seats were comfortable.  We have a Britax Parkway SGL as well.  The Britax looks more comfortable (thicker cushion, etc) but is larger so a little more difficult to seat belt than these seats.  Ironically, my daughters prefer these seats, claiming that there are more comfortable than the Britax.  I think that it's because it's a little easier getting in and out of.  There is some concern  expressed by one of the reviews  that this cannot be tightly attached.  I think that is wrong.  One of the other reviews pointed out that you need to pull on each of the straps separately rather than both at the same time.  That works very well.  I have no trouble keeping the chair attached tightly.  These are good chairs and we will be buying another set for my parents so that they can take the grand kids out"

I was skeptical on the ease of inflating it but it took less than 30 seconds and the quality was great. My son didn't complain while sitting on this and it stayed in place. It allowed the seat belt to go comfortably across his lap.<br /><br />I am planning on ordering a second one for my younger child as well now as it's safe and easy to for travelling.

0,3,0,0,1,,"I purchased this seat for my grandson who I pick up from preschool a few times a month. The seat was less than 6 months old- and had minimal usage. The area around the bottom buckle is torn after such a short period of time & very little use. I cannot recommend this seat to parents. Also, side note - customer service was very slow to reply ( more than a week between responses) and has refused to replace the cover material because I did not keep my receipt from more than 5 months ago. The car seat’s model info even showed that it was less than 6 months old. They do not stand behind their warranty or quality. Pay a little more and get better quality and service."

Definitely love it knowing it’ll be keeping my daughter safe at all times in the car. Only thing I would say is I wish I could place her in the middle seat but with the way my suv is set up , is if her car seat is in the middle it’ll be almost impossible for anyone to sit and buckle their seat on either side of her. So I have her behind the passenger side. No biggie tho.  Great car seat and definitely recommend"

0,3,0,2,3,,This is the 2nd Britax I have purchased. This one is for the 2nd grandson who is a bit huskier than the first grandson. it is a little wider than the boulevard model and I like the light grey color as I am in a very hot/sunny area it reflects the heat. I have it installed in rear facing now and it takes up quite a bit of leg room - I have a Toyota double cab and the front seat cannot go back all the way as I have it tethered to the seat rail (our CHP is the one who installed it like this). It was easy to install and the latches and buckles are easy to use. I like the velcro sides to hold the seat belts away while putting him in and out of the seat. Great buy.
1,4,1,2,0,,Great buy. Not hard or soft. Easy for my daughter to carry and use. Seat belt adjuster is easy for her to use.
2,5,0,0,5,,"Suitable for a larger infant and older. The seat does not seem to tilt back far enough for small newborns and my baby's chin falls to her chest while in the seat. It does not seem to be safe for her at this time, but when she's bigger and can support her head more it will be a good fit for us."
0,3,3,0,3,,"Shoddy construction with regard to the softer material that provides comfort to your child..  the padding on ours fell off within a couple of years and was impossible to put back into place.  To be sure this car seat seemed great and very solid at first... but doesn’t hold up well over time.  I’d recommend a less expensive, battle tested model.  We bought this one assuming that the high cost would mean high quality.  We were wrong.  The “core” construction is solid but it seems as if the team that designed the soft cloth and upholstery (if you will) were not holding themselves to any goal beyond satisfying short term cosmetic appearance needs for “wow-ing” consumers."
1,3,0,0,0,,"I recently purchased the Triumph for my daughter who has two pricier car seats so that she could provide her babysitter with a safe carseat.  We have a total of 5 of these car seats in our family at this point and the quality and safety rating is very good without paying a fortune for the high end seat.  I find two downsides to this carseat--one:  the car seat is not the easiest to attach to your car because it needs to be tight to be safe (I can't put it in myself)--two:  the tightening knob on the harness system is rather difficult to turn -- I wish it worked a little easier as I'm the grandma and don't have the best strength in my hands.  Otherwise, the carseat is fairly well padded, it is safe and reliable.  I would recommend this product."

0,3,0,0,0,,"There are several things I really like about this seat. I was drawn to it initially because it was at a great price point, which was important to me, because we needed to purchase two for our twin boys. I really like that it has two cup holders, one for drink and one for a snack and they come out easily for cleaning! I recommend strongly looking at measurements and/or testing this seat out in your particular vehicle to make sure it will fit, because it is very large, especially rear-facing. It fits well in the captain chairs of our mini van, but may be too big for smaller vehicles. Easy to tighten and loosen the straps, once you get used to it. All of the nooks and crannies that all car seats have vacuum out very easily. The process of adjusting the strap height is very easy to do as well. Good seat all around."

Currently it needs to be rear facing with her size and weight. At first when I attempted to put it in, it just didn't look like it seemed secured enough to be rear facing. There is no slot like the seat has for when it is facing forward to slid the seat belt and fasten it through tightly. I had to visit a friend who is a volunteer firefighter to make sure I installed it correctly, and he had to really tighten it to make it secure.  Overall its a great product, the colors match my vehicle and so far its been very easy to maintain for food and formula spills. I bought it based off of previous reviewers recommending it but I do wish it had a more easily accessible slot to install the seat when rear facing."

1,7,0,0,3,,"We bought this WAYB Pico Travel Car Seat earlier on during its first introduction. Seat is great but has a major design flaw... it locks upright in one position only and we couldn't tilt it a little back without unlocking the bottom aluminum snap-on lock. When we traveled on Spirit airline, the airplane seat by default was bit tilted and this seat's backrest couldn't be tilted back snugly against the plane seat backrest without us unlocking the Pico's bottom snap-on lock otherwise the Pico seat kept on moving to-n-fro whenever our child tried to move. We couldn't firmly put on the plane seat belt unto this Pico seat without tilting it's back which would then raise its bottom base up. So throughout the trip we had to keep the Pico seat bottom base snap-on lock unlocked. Just wondering if others have also pointed this out and whether they made improvement to the design of the seat to make it tilt through some option in lock position."

I'm just a little more careful putting my child in the seat.<br />I've had to spot clean and the best product I've found for that is warm soapy water or Watkins all purpose cleaner.<br />If I'm blessed with another child I'll deffently purchase another one!"

1,4,0,2,0,,"We were pleased with our Britax Marathon, so decided to get another Britax with room to grow. It has a low profile - the seat is closer to the car's seat, and the back isn't as thick.  Works well in our compact car.  Love that no re-threading is required to adjust the height.  While not terrible, we found this more complicated to put together and install than the Marathon.  Cup holders are a nice feature, but are placed too far forward to be effective for our toddler. Our daughter is comfortable in the seat, and we appreciate the breathable fabric during a hot summer."

4,4,1,1,4,"STURDY, STABLE, SECURE","We bought two of these. These seemed to work ok, as neither of our kids really seemed to mind sitting on them, although one of them struggled to stay on the seat.<br /><br />My biggest critique is, while a relatively simple concept, instructions were lacking - especially regarding the seatbelt retention strap.<br /><br />Even when going to the manufacturer’s website as suggested, there was no evident setup instruction on either the “product instructions” page, nor on the page for the UberBoost item page, itself. We ended up on a 3rd party “mommy blog” to even figure out what it was for.<br /><br />Additionally, for our younger child, the seat moved out from under him on a regular basis. While the bottom of the seatcover IS very grippy, it seems like there should be some better way to secure the seat. Again, this may have simply been due to a lack of good instructions."

2,3,3,0,3,,"I am a 54 yr. old Memaw of 4 grandbabies, with 2 more coming!  I transport all of them often, and have come to detest most car seats.  I am currently on the hunt for a convertible car seat that 1 woman can properly install and tighten sufficiently BY HERSELF.  I purchased the Britax Boulevard for over $300 this week.  The English version of the instructions is 46 pages long.  I worked for an hour last night, and an hour this afternoon, attempting to install it by myself.  Impossible.  I am 5' 9"" tall, 120 lbs., and an avid practitioner of yoga, and I still do not possess the weight or contortionist skills necessary to get the job done.  The description on Amazon clearly states ""easy installation"".  If they are referring to the installation of the BABY, then okay, sure, it is not the worst car seat to buckle a small child into.  But if they are referring to the installation of the car seat into a vehicle, they are DEAD WRONG.  Not to mention, that if the car seat is installed behind my drivers seat I cannot drive the vehicle....I have to move the seat all the way forward to get the dang car seat in the back.  At 5' 9"", I gotta have some leg room.  If the car seat is installed behind the front passenger seat, then there is no room for a passenger to ride in the front for the same reason.  This is beyond ridiculous.  I will continue the hunt until I find something I can actually use safely.  BIG thumbs down on the Britax Boulevard."
1,3,3,0,3,,"Beautiful carseat. We've never owned anything but Britax, the quality far surpasses anything else on the market. My grandson is 8, and still fits into his Britax Pioneer.

Our other Graco & Brittax seats also have a latch system but have to be tightened individually (and in the back).  I like the single tightening cord in the front.

Remember, solo momma with a five year old, her bag, my bag, whatever stuffies and pillow she had and this on my back through San Francisco Airport.

1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel","We bought this for a trip that included limo service to/from the airport, a couple flights, and a rental car while we were there and this was the perfect travel booster seat solution.  Just a few quick breaths and we had it ready for the limo ride, quick open of the valve and rolled up into our carry-on bag, then blew it up again to use the whole time in the rental car, then again just as easily back into our carry-on for easy access and quick use again for the limo ride home.  No complaints from the seat's occupant although I had read some felt like they were slipping off, etc, we didn't see that issue with our 8 year old.  I would strongly recommend this as a travel solution for kids needing booster seats.  Keep in mind booster seats are not permitted for use on planes unless they have been FAA approved so again, something like this that stores quickly, compactly, and easily into a carry-on or suitcase is likely to be the easiest solution."

LOVE IT! The car seat snaps right into the stroller seamlessly and rides so incredibly smoothly. This infant carrier is just a little bit heavier than other carriers but the safety benefits are worth it in my opinion. Installation of the base is easy and straight forward and the carrier snaps in and out with no trouble. Let’s not forgot about this adorable cow print. I highly reccommend Britax!!

She definitely looks very comfortable and I am having a better experience at driving longer distances with her. Her previous car seat seemed to allow her to sit a bit more crunched but this seat has a little back support. The installation was a bit tricky because there are so many straps and pieces to the support of the seat. But once figured out it is easy to use.  I suggest adjusting the seat before installing into the car because it makes it ten times easier."

Behind the cover is a U-shaped piece of styrofoam (um, ""EPS energy absorbing foam""), covering the back and wrapping the around the side bolsters. So when the child grabs onto the sides they may flex and break.

Having a stroller, carry-on, carseat, backpack and 2yr old was just not an option so I was delighted to find this to cut out the stroller!

4,4,1,1,0,,"We've had this about 2 years, and it's has its high points (cleans up well, and my daughter finds it comfortable), but there are 2 flaws worth calling out:<br /><br />#1: The cupholders are just way too shallow.  They're designed to fit something short and squat, like a sippy cup.  So if your child has a regular-size water bottle or, say, a cup of pop, you'd better be careful not to brake hard ever, or it'll be on the floor.  We just bought a new car and for this reason alone I would not buy another Turbobooster, because I don't want to be drying off/cleaning up stuff off the floor mats.<br /><br />#2: The seatbelt guides aren't really well designed.  The seatbelt is constantly falling out and it's really annoying.<br /><br />On the GOOD side, it's easy to position the seatbelt on my daughter's shoulder in this seat, and the lower portion fits flat on her thighs as it should. So for seat belt fit, as long as the seatbelt hasn't fallen out yet again, it's doing its job."

The fact that it gives my daughter more leg room and thw headrest/harness adjusts to 10 different levels was great. My daughter is 2 and only 24lbs so I still have her rear facing because to me it seems safer with her weight. I'm ready to put the other Graco 4ever in my husband truck and buy another 1 of these for my car lol. Oh and it arrived 1 day after ordering it. I chose this carseat when I read the reviews and the lady totaled her car but her daughter was unharmed due to this carseat. I'm glad I chose it, easy to install and its really cute."

As first time parents the instructions were difficult to understand as the seat needed to be adjusted underneath to accommodate a newborn.

I use a stroller daily for transporting my twins and now I cannot safely. I emailed customer service twice and have gotten no response."

1,4,1,2,0,Cup Holder,Originally purchased a Evenflo Amp for one vehicle and this one for the primary vehicle. This seat is very sturdy and appears to be constructed well and my daughter loves it. The Evenflo was obviously less quality than less.
1,4,1,2,0,Cup Holder,My daughter moved into the booster seat when she was 4.  She is tall for her age and she fits well in it.  She is now almost 6 and the chair still supports her.  The adjustment levels for height are great.  it allows us to keep her in the booster seat longer with the back support.  she likes the back support on long trips because she can still lean up against the side when she falls asleep verses slumping over without it so she also has asked us to keep it on.  The only draw back is that the cup holders are too shallow to hold cups.  They topple over.  i wish they could be a little deeper or have some grip on the sides to help hold the cups in them.

4,2,0,0,0,,"We have had problems with this car seat from day one and our child is now 6 months old. For newborns, the seat is way too upright and provides no head support for a small baby (6 lbs). Now that our daughter is an infant we still have issues. She just hates this seat. There isn't any padding and she is visibly uncomfortable. She rarely falls asleep in the seat, even on long trips, and is generally agitated as soon as we put her in. We have taken our car to our local hospital to have the installation/settings checked several times and everything checks out. Our daughter loves riding in one grandma's Graco size4me convertible seat (that was half the price of this seat) and the other grandma's Chicco KeyFit seat (also less expensive). We are going to go ahead and upgrade to a convertible seat because this one has been such a disappointment, won't use it for baby #2."

0,5,0,0,3,Fits 3 across,"I would not recommend this seat if you are able to fit any other seat. This is heavy,  difficult to install, and almost impossible to get tight. In RF you absolutely have to use the RF tether to get it to within the allowed 1"" movement. Nuts. LATCH install works a little better than seat belt, but the LATCH weight limit is really low, I think 30 or 35 lbs because the seat itself is a whopping 25lbs. IMPORTANT: The bottom part of the seat is really low, so I could not get this to work with stalk buckles. The buckle would rest against the seat's side, making it simply impossible to pull the belt tight enough. I ran into this problem in an Acura MDX. For recessed buckles, this wasn't an issue, but it's still really hard to get the seat tight enough because it's so tall and the bottom is so low. You really have to use the tether to stabilize the seat, like a very tall mast! The harness also doesn't have an ez slide adjust like many other seats... I don't know why for 25 freaking lbs, they couldn't put one of those, or built in lock-offs. If I didn't need to make space for a 3rd passenger in the back seat, I'd get something else."

It's no secret that European car seats are subject to different regulations (and many feel they are better) than American ones -- for example, in the EU, for Side Impact Protection (SIP), brands need to comply with the EU standard for SIP.  But in the US, there is no unified standard at this time, and SIP isn't even a requirement.<br /><br />The Primo Viaggio's head panel is also EURO-NCAP compliant, an additional safety measure which European companies can further push their standards. Just placing your child in this seat, you'll FEEL the snug security this offers.

This seat has also come in handy during times when we all wanted to carpool spur of the moment.

0,3,0,0,3,,"For the price this was really designed very poorly. It won't tighten down properly if your back seat is slightly angled so the manual literally suggests using a rolled towel. It still doesn't feel super secure. The 5 point harness takes an act of God to tighten properly.  Even once it tightens down it all moves alot.  I suggest buying a seat that has two LATCH clicks that are independent of one another. We ended up buying a different car seat for the other vehicle and I really wish we had returned this one and bought two of the other. And if your little one falls asleep in the car, their head will most assuredly be resting on their chest.  It's honestly just terrible all around."

The modern sleek look of these seats had me stopping and reading the reviews and although some stated they were on the big side, I took a chance on them and I'm so glad I did. I have an older model Honda Odyssey and the seats fit perfectly. They were easy to assemble as you snap together the top and bottom part which were separated in the box. It was pretty simple to hook them in my van as I attached the two ancore hooks on the bottom of the booster seat to the van's seat. The seats are sturdy once strapped in correctly and don't move around. Then I weaved the seat belt through the hole in the booster chair as seen in pic. They feel nice, look nice, and have good safety features as the sides are wide enough for protection and comfort. They also have two pull out cup holders on both sides of the seats that can fit juice boxes and snacks. These seats are really nice as I've gotten complaments from other moms about them too, so if you have the room these booster seats are great to have."

1,4,1,0,3,,"This is our second Graco Nautilus car seat, and I'm only leaving this review to update feedback on a seat that has seen some running changes.<br /><br />First let me say that my wife and I love our first Nautilus that we purchased about 2 years ago.  This new seat appears mostly the same but has a few key differences that reduce the its appeal.  I'll note them here:<br /><br />*Buckle is different - now a ""push in"" vs. the older ""push down"" and smaller.  Just not as friendly and easy to use as the old latch.<br />*Locking clips - the two clips that get inserted into that changed buckle are now smaller and here's the worst part, they slide more easily on the straps.  What this means is that with the old seat those clips would stay roughly in position when you unbuckled your child.  Now with the looser clips, you will find they always end up sitting awkwardly at the base of the seat, right back at that very rear corner.  This requires you to dig under your child to get them every time you buckle them in. Sigh.<br />*Liner.  Liner just tends to slide around a lot more in the seat making it more of a hassle to use.<br />*Smaller buckle and loose liner combo.  Both of the above changes, looser liner, smaller buckle cause the buckle to pop out of the liner slot if/when your child ""slides"" out of the seat.  This means that if you aren't paying attention the next time you put them into the seat you are digging around, again, under their bum to navigate the buckle back through the liner slot.  It just makes you want to ditch the liner entirely.<br /><br />Anyway, this is still a good car seat, it's just not a great as is used to be and new buyers should be aware of these running changes."

The foam under the butt ripped off after about 6 months of use because the poorly designed tabs that are intended to hold the cover on do not. The single pull strap for mounting is a nice thought but it make it much harder to install. It never really gets as tight as I want it. And for what its worth, my cheapo car seats have ratcheting straps and install in seconds. Why can't Britax come up with something like that at twice the price? Further, the strap gets jammed in the clips when tightening it. Then you have to pull every muscle in your back to get it loose again. I have another Britax carseat. The carseat is a much superior design and comes with two pull points. This piece of junk was designed to meet a low cost point and I assume the margin was very good on it. The consequence is a very low quality product that functions poorly. I won't buy Britax anything after owning this heap of garbage."

1,5,1,2,3,Cup Holder,"Update jan. 2015... Still an incredible seat. Taking it apart to wash it also easier than seats we've had in the past. I noticed some reviews on tightening so wanted to add my experience. This seat does not tighten like ordinary car seats, I find I have to press in the little metal  mechanism for loosening it to tighten as well but then it tightens and stays perfectly. Recently with winter coats some days and sweatshirts another we've done a lot of this but the seat is still my favorite of all seats (including other britax models) we've owned.<br /><br />I ended up ordering this seat for my 2 1/2 year old after we were in an accident and had to replace car seats. THIS SEAT IS THE BEST. I had a newer Britax convertible before and loved it but this is so much butter... but the CLICKTIGHT installation seat belt locking mechanism in this pinacle is awesome. I was skeptical after reading the description and instruction manual as to whether it would be as tight as the LATCH system (but figured it came with the latch so if need be I'd use that)-- but it is sooooo much better better than the LATCH and so easy! I always had to have my husband tighten the car seats after putting them in with the latch to get them in real tight-- NOT WITH THIS SYSTEM! So easy.. you just run the seatbelt through the seat where it tells you, lock the seat down over it and it is done... and the seat is locked in much tighter than I could ever get it with the latch. Getting it out is even easier... you just press the squeeze the buttons that are secured under a seat panel and unbuckle the belt and out you go.<br /><br />As for the size- it is a nice big seat- so perfect for toddlers with all the safety features, everything is adjustable. Another great option I wish Britax did on all of their car seats-- BUILT IN CUPHOLDER!!! Perfect for toddlers that want a drink in the car with them. If I would have know about this, I would have moved my daughter into this when she was 1.... This seat is heavy-- there is no doubt when you pick it up that this is well built. I wouldn't hesistate to buy or spend the extra money on this at all... well worth it."

1,3,4,2,0,Removable Seat Cushion,"I bought a Britax Marathon a little under two years ago for my son, thinking they are the best and would last the longest. It's a pretty big price to pay for a car seat, but I figured it would be better to pay a little more for something that we could use longer. The car seat has been nice, not too much more to note than our other cheaper car seats, but it's done its job and felt safe. Today I notched the stitching on the top of the car seat was coming undone and leaving a big hole. The car seat sits in our car, hardly ever moved, for my two year old son. I don't have any idea how the stitching could already be coming undone. I called Britax, hoping that they would stand by their product and send me a new cover for it, but they won't. They give you one year. Even my cheaper Chicco car seat and stroller have been happy to send new parts when there's are failing, in a reasonable time frame, even over a year. For the cost of this seat, the cover should not be falling apart after less than two years. I'm very disappointed in the product, but also very disappointed that a company such as this would not stand by their product and fix the problem. I have a cheap but comparible car seat from Costco that my six year old sits in, never a stitch undone and never a problem. Britax has definitely lost a customer."

One weird side effect though- we started calling it our kid’s “squatty potty” because every. single. time he gets into it, he poops within 2 minutes. Initially when we got this, he was only 3 months old so not eating solids yet. Unfortunately, that meant blow-out city. Not sure what it is about the car seat but maybe the tilt or something, but I had to clean it after just about every trip due to his blowouts. Luckily he’s eating solids now, so we haven’t had a blowout in it in a couple of months (knock on wood). I will say, if you’re kid is constipated, get this car seat and it’ll solve your problem."

It sits - with ample room to spare - between two other child's car seats and there is plenty of space.<br /><br />Buckling in and out is easy. Just guide the regular lap-belt portion of your car's standard seatbelts through the two red guide clips, and you're done. This literally takes seconds to do and is far less complicated than I feared from reading some of the descriptions online.<br /><br />Set-up was also super-easy. Just blow-it up like a balloon, insert the air-stopping valve and you're done. The added bonus is that the BubbleBum also serves as a portable option - so if your child is traveling in a different car.....or if you need something for a taxi or a rental car.....it's extremely portable."

We love it!<br /><br />PROS:<br />My son seems comfortable in it, whether he's awake or asleep.<br />The harness is easy to adjust.<br />I love that the fabric is soft and doesn't get hot (like vinyl can) and that it's easy to clean.<br />It works great both rear and front facing.<br />The seat fits him very well. He is 33"" tall, 28 lbs., and almost 2 years old. This seat fits as well now as it did a year ago. I can see him fitting in it for at least another year, probably two.<br /><br />CONS:<br />It's bulkier and harder to get in and out of the car than infant seats are, but that is to be expected of a toddler seat.<br />When the seat was new, the dial that you use to loosen or tighten the harness belts sometimes was ""sticky"" or difficult to release and turn. We are used to pushing harder, and it also has become less ""sticky."""

We do not have any other seats in the car anymore since this is my youngest - but the extra space I notice is really nice. We are already on the second to highest shoulder strap level, so that is my biggest concern that he may outgrow it quickly - but the specifications imply he should be fine for at least a year so I guess it will depend on our growth spurts this year."

It’s not as “luxurious” as the Graco but is more comfortable for my girl. It feels a little cheaper but gets the job done.

2,3,0,0,1,,"This seat is a lot cheaper than most others, and it really shows. Adjustment for the child's height is difficult, involving detaching and re-attaching the shoulder straps from the back. Recline angle isn't adjustable, except by moving the entire seat, and then there's nothing to keep it in position unless you stuff a rolled-up towel behind it. The real deal-killer though is that in the rear-facing mode it is impossible to tighten either the LATCH belt or the car belt enough for safely: the seat shifts around too much.<br /><br />Returned, and replaced by a GRACO costing more than twice as much. That's sad, but there's a reason.<br /><br />Note:My vehicle is a Mustang Mach E. YMMV."

The latch system for the other carseat didn't work in my car but this one is PERFECT! It's super simple to install, too! Also, my girl has long legs so giving her some extra leg room is wonderful! The safety features are also awesome! The harness is easy to move up or down as needed! It also seems really comfy for my girl!

She is a small almost 4 year old that legally can be in a booster, but is in no way ready for that. This is a perfect compromise as she is still strapped in a five point harness, but has the option to be a booster later. Our absolute favorite part about this seat is how easy it is to install. The new ratcheting latch system is fantastic! You simply click the hooks in and push on the seat to automatically ratchet tight. It is the tightest install we have been able to achieve with a child car seat and it is so easy to move from car to car because of the simplicity of installation. We can now leave the carseats with grandparents and rest assured that our kids will be safe in their cars too because they will be able to install the carseats correctly."

Perhaps a ratcheting mechanism would work better (like the tie downs for a pick up).  My other gripe is the recline (or lack of recline).  The 2 provided positions are both too straight up... whenever my baby falls asleep in the car his head falls forward in a very uncomfortable looking position.  It seems this would be resolved with a better recline.  Almost makes me feel like they didn't have parents test this before they started selling them.  Given the chance i'd pass on this one and get something that A) has a better recline for sleeping babies and B) is easier to install snug and tight

Three days later, I took the seat back out of the car, and my leather seats had some pretty severe indentations from the underside of the seat.<br /><br />I really don’t understand why the base of the car seat would do that to a car.

It was easy to install in both my Tahoe and my Prius (took less than 10 min to get it done).  It tightened down so well that it doesn't wiggle at all.  (I actually used both the latch and the seatbelt to secure it since the latch system has a lower weight limit than the 5 point harness on the seat but it was unmoving with just the latch).  This is one of the first seats I have not needed to have the local fire department install in order to have it completely correct.  I was able to tighten out all of the wiggle myself.  It was also easy to adjust for my child's height (with a lot of room to grow despite him being tall).  It has 2 positions for the buckle strap so I was able to move it out and not let my son's genital area be uncomfortable from a tight strap.  My son loves it.  He actually asked to go extra places for the first few weeks because he liked riding in it so much.  We have taken a 9 hour car trip with out a single complaint of being uncomfortable.  My son likes the extra cubbies to hide snacks or toys and the drink holder works well to hold a sippy cup or water bottle.  Unlike most other car seats, he is unable to unclick himself because of the design of the buckle.  The material is easy to wipe down and the cover can be removed and washed if needed.  I haven't found a negative in the first few months and 2 thousand miles of use."

2,4,0,0,1,,"My now 5 year old has been in this seat since he was 4 months old. He was rear facing until about 2 1/2 and had no issues as far as leg room. He would just fling them over the side or prop them up. Now at 5 years we are still using the 5 point harness forward facing but I am thinking soon we will move on to using as a booster. He is about 39.5 lbs and 43 inches. This is his favorite seat, he tells me all the time how much more comfortable it is than the seat in my husbands car and MIL’s car. He likes that this one is big enough for him to pull his feet up and sit criss cross applesauce. He has spilled, puked, pooped and whatever else you can think of in this seat as all kids do. It is so easy to remove the cover and throw in the wash and then just spray down the frame/base. You don’t even have to remove the entire seat to get the cover off. It’s no harder than any other seat to install. It just takes some elbow grease to get it tight. Sometimes I’ll sit in it and have my husband pull the straps. We love this seat and highly recommend it."

1,3,3,2,3,,"After using the click tight feature I can't imagine using another car seat. It really puts my mind at ease to hear the &#34;click&#34; when I tighten or loosen the straps because I know the fit is appropriate and my little ones are safe. Kids grow fast, and sometimes sweaters, pants, etc. are thicker than other clothing items worn the day before so you do adjust the straps to keep your child comfortable and safe more than you think. I'm frugal, but spend the extra money on the convenient click tight feature, you won't regret it. Another HUGE perk of this car seat is how easy it is to transfer from one car to another. We did not want to buy car seats for my husbands car (because we have two under two) and it is pain free process moving them often. This is a great car seat!!"

You can tell she is well protected and comfortable. It is easy to keep clean. Installation is a breeze. Most importantly, I feel secure that she will be safe in the event of an accident. It is worth every penny. We are expecting baby number two in a few weeks and actually just purchased a second one for him to use when he gets bigger.

1,4,1,0,3,,We went on a trip and rented a car seat.  It happened to be this one.  After we got home and started to use our original one we decided we had to buy this one.  My son is a big 3.  He is already wearing 5-6 size clothing so that tells you how  big he is.  This seat fits him so much better and he still has room to grow.  I like that it transitions into a booster and still provides head protection.

1,3,3,2,3,,"I am a huge fan of Britax and their car seats. The clicktight is a bit tricky sometimes especially if your like me and don't ever read manuals and just figure &#34; I know what I'm doing&#34;. It's not that hard, but just reading the basics on how to install helps a lot. It is a heavy seat, more heavy than most brands.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy ish install-makes transferring from vehicle to vehicle easy<br />Different positions available to make RF to FF more simple<br />No rethreading the buckles when your child hits a growth spurt,just press a button and pull the top part up( I can't express enough how much this will make your lives easier, rethreading the buckles are a hassle because you have to take the cover off etc.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />If the seatbelt is tethered too tight it can be hard to push the seat down and lock it, some rethreading maybe necessary in the first few time before you get your feel<br /><br />Sometimes the seat leans to one side no matter how many time I reposition the seat and reinstall, it's not a huge safety concern, but I am planning an appt with a car seat tech to see if I am doing anything wrong.<br /><br />The cup holder attachment is difficult, I still haven't figured it out yet.<br /><br />All and all it is a great seat.  Although I have not installed the seat using the tethers and have only done the seatbelt install I am very satisfied with the seat overall."

0,2,1,2,3,,"After using this for 5 mos, I broke down and bought a Graco 35 Click Connect. Even if I only use it for a few more months with our baby, it is better than feeling like my arms are going to snap off and my shins getting bruises. The 40 is so cumbersome and unwieldy it's not worth it. It sounds good it theory but you are NOT going to want to lug around your child in a carrier when they're reaching the max limits of this. Our baby is 15 lbs and the carrier alone is almost 10. I found myself making up excuses to not run errands and get out with her as much because carrying her in this is so exhausting. It takes up an entire shopping cart if you set them in one. Also, it just takes up more room in general anywhere you go. I jokingly call it the &#34;Spruce Goose&#34; because it is comically large and over the top. You are not going to save any money by trying to stretch the time until you have to get &#34;big kid&#34; car seat. You're better off getting a click connect or classic connect because they are more versatile. The 40 will ONLY fit with the 40 base and won't connect on any of the strollers,etc."

I'm sure they tested it on one car and it fit in and they called it a day. I have attempted to install it into 4 different cars. In 3 of those cars it was an infuriating awful experience and I eventually got it in. The 4th car it was impossible. The only way to get the car seat in would be to have the bubble meter outside the safe zone. So I have to choose between my kid being safe and getting the stupid car seat in. ONE FREAKING INCH!

0,3,0,0,3,,"First and foremost: I am a former CPST & a mom of 3. We travel by air and I've installed in a LOT of cars.<br /><br />1. This seat is AMAZING for extended rear facing. You can easily rear face a child to age 4, possibly longer. My oldest is 5 and still fits rear facing at 44inches and 43lbs.<br /><br />2. This seat is compact. Front to back it is more compact than a Chicco Nextfit, Britax CT, Diono with angle adjuster, and Clek Foonf. I am 5ft 11inchs, this seat is the most comfortable in sedans and behind the driver.<br /><br /> 3. This seat allows for the vehicle seat to touch it.<br /><br /> 4. This seat has a very broad range for acceptable angles. It can be more upright or more reclined.  This is great when rear facing in small spaces.<br /><br />5. The fabric as held up over the years. No snags. Minimal fading. And it's stayed clean. Easy to wash. The only wear is a little pilling on the harness straps.<br /><br />6. The forward facing install with a seatbelt can be a little annoying but not difficult at all.<br /><br />7. Not bad for a 3 across situation.<br /><br />8. Peg does not require a replacement after ANY crash. Only after certian criteria.  So if you bump a mailbox at 3mph and scratch your bumper, you wont be required to replace like major brands require.<br /><br />There are trendy seats, like the rava and the foonf. I've had both. (I have 9 car seats.) But out of all of my years (8) this is the one seat I've never resold, traded, or replaced. It's stayed in our rotation and as soon as it expired another was purchased."

None of that head hung over broken neck look they get with the straight seats.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Does not face the rear, so you have to wait a little longer to transition from the infant carrier.<br />The waste seat belts have no lower limit so you have to dig them out from under your kid every time.<br />The cup holder and so called storage spots(open areas under the arm rests) are not removable so you need to vacuum them out or remove the car seat and shake it out<br />The upper quick mount has a minimum distance of about 6 inches which is fine for the car but my truck needed about 2 inches"

1,4,1,1,0,,"This product has very glaring built in flaw but that is not what irks me, it is the callous attitude of their Customer Service in trying to justify that flaw as an integral design feature. The idea behind the product is exemplary but executions is far from lacking.

But the attitude & callousness of their customer service makes me wonder if this company should even be in child safety business.<br /><br />UPDATE: September 17th 2017<br /><br />My earlier review was diligently followed up by Mi-Folds management.

0,2,0,0,5,,"I'm also posting a review about the stroller/wheels you can buy for this thing, which I do not recommend.<br /><br />My baby is 3 1/2 months as of this review.<br /><br />First of all, it seems like it's a safe carseat, and that's the most important thing.  I wouldn't know though, of course, and thank God.  But I do really like the side impact protection aspect of it, and that's why we bought it.<br /><br />As far as ease of use--which I believe is actually a HUGE safety factor--I think it's fairly difficult to figure out how to use at first.  I'm a very particular guy who figures out how to use things really easily, and this thing left me puzzled for a couple hours.  Now truth be told, I've never used a baby car seat before--never had a reason to.  But being a new dad, I wanted to get this right.<br /><br />I think any company making a safe baby seat--or any baby seat for that matter--should have very clear instructions about how to install it properly.  Especially considering the frightening statistics that a majority of parents improperly install their baby car seats.  So what good is a safe seat if you can't install it properly?<br /><br />If I weren't a first time user, I would have less trouble, but that doesn't take them off the hook.<br /><br />The instruction booklet it comes with is not very helpful whatsoever--just a scrap paper that has some images.<br /><br />We were able to use it when our baby first came out of the hospital, without feeling like it was too big for her.  The seat was huge, but the straps can be ""restrung"" in a way that it fits even an infant--our baby was 8-9 pounds.  So very safe there.  The little infant cushioning worked well for the first month or so, before she outgrew it.<br /><br />The baby seat is big, which is a negative in terms of having to scoot the passenger seat forward uncomfortably (for whoever is sitting there), but we wanted a bigger one so that it would last longer for our child and save a few bucks.<br /><br />One of the negatives of this (along with the stroller) that has driven us nuts is that it doesn't always click and lock in properly when we put it on the base.  Nor is it easy to remove.  That's a safety issue because if it's not clicked in properly your baby will go flying in an accident.  They say that there should be a loud ""snapping"" sound on each side that clicks in so that you absolutely know when it's on properly. That's true, but it doesn't always make that sound, and it doesn't always click in right.  The way the plastic works there, it could be a better design.  So that always makes me question whether I have it in or not, and then I yank the darn thing around to make sure, which you should always do, but I do it particularly violently (unfortunately for my sleeping baby) to make sure she's locked in.<br /><br />Then when my wife tries to remove the car seat (especially when the passenger seat is slightly bumped against it), she can't get the darn thing unlocked and out.  She's a patient woman who's being tested (by the baby and now this seat).  I've figured it out more easily, but sometimes it still takes a few tries to get out, and by then you've woken up your baby again.<br /><br />In case you don't read my review of the stroller that you can buy with it $69.99 - it really sucks.  I don't think you have another option, but if I had to do it again, I wouldn't buy this car seat for that reason alone.  The thing is awful--the wheels don't turn properly and the lock mechanism doesn't work well not to mention has jammed my fingernails a couple times.<br /><br />Good luck for those of you with this thing.  I do believe it will keep my baby safe, but there are issues with this that shouldn't be there."

The kid's been using it for only about two months, and he's only 10+ months old, so he's not in a position to do much damage yet. Time will tell.<br />- Installation is a breeze! The ClickTight feature makes sure the seat is really secure and tight, since it actually presses down on the belt straps to increase tension.<br />- The little window on the side for angling is very intuitive, so it's easy to make sure the angle is appropriate for the age of the child.<br />- The lever to angle the seat is super easy to operate.<br />- The lever at the top of the seat makes it REALLY easy to adjust the height of the headrest, and it controls the strap height at the same time.<br />- Finally, The button to release the straps is very easy to access, easier than on their B-Safe infant seat.<br />- The fit and finish is top quality. It better be, for the price.<br /><br />They've really thought through the details. But the most important selling feature to me was the ability to fit it in my car. I have a late 80s E30 BMW 325iX 4-door, and the back seat is not very roomy. I tried the Diono Radian because it has such a wide weight range and can be converted to a booster seat, but there was no way it was gong to fit in my car, the back is way too tall. The Britax has a very nice curved back, very low profile, and it actually fit! I doubt any other seat would have fit, but the compact shape works, though not at the expense of weight/height range. So I'll have to buy a booster seat eventually.<br /><br />I've used Britax products before, with the B-Safe seat/B-Agile stroller combo. LOVED that system as well, it's the reason I went back to them for the Boulevard. The airline broke our stroller, and when I called Britax to try to get a replacement part, they explained that the part wasn't available separately due to being too difficult to replace. So with no questions asked, they simply took all the steps necessary to replace the entire stroller in the quickest, most convenient and pain-free way possible. They had all my info available from registration, and it couldn't have been easier. It never occurred to me before I was a parent how much I would value the ease and lack of stress of replacing product. Clearly, Britax understands how little time and energy parents have to give to stuff like this, and have implemented great processes to make it as easy as possible on their customers. While it's not THE deciding factor to buy Britax product, poor or lacking customer service would be a deciding factor to NOT buy from car seat brand.<br /><br />The only feature I'm not that fond of are the rubber pads that surround the straps where the chest clip sits. They have to float on the straps so that their position can be adjusted, but it does mean one more thing to make sure it's in the correct spot. I won't take them off, since they're part of the safety and comfort of the strap system, and I have gotten used to it, so it's a quicker process now to buckle the kid in. But it's just slightly annoying."
3,5,0,0,3,Fits 3 Across,"I have a 2019 Chevy Equinox and needed to be able to fit three car seats across the backseat. I have two Diono Radians (1 FF, 1RF) and a Britax BSafe 35, and I can fit them all. The RF Radian is behind the passenger seat and renders the front seat pretty much useless. I’m 5’6” and my knees were almost touching the dashboard. I do not have the angle adjuster for the seat. This isn’t a dealbreaker for us because the Equinox is not our primary vehicle and that RF seat will soon be turned FF. My major complaint, though, is that I have a tall 5 year old, and he has nearly outgrown the seat at the highest position. In our other vehicle we have a Graco 4ever, and he will easily fit in that seat for another year! For the price point of this seat, I was disappointed that it will not last him very long, and I’m not looking forward to having to buy another type of seat soon. Installation was not as bad as the reviews make it sound! At 20 weeks pregnant I was able to easily install the seats by myself, and I’m very confident that they are securely installed. Just watch a quick installation video on YouTube! All in all, if you need three across, these are great seats."
2,3,0,0,3,,"I bought the ever popular Graco 4Ever and this extend to fit. I read all the reviews for both and ultimately ended up returning the 4Ever and keeping this extend to fit. The leg room it provides on backwards facing is super cool. It’s just as easy to install as the 4Ever, and just as light and compact."
1,3,0,0,5,,"We bought this car seat with our oldest who is now three and now our one year old is using it.<br /><br />Both kids love it and the oldest say's that it's very comfortable especially compared to the Graco (that we actually hate but was given to us) that is in my husbands truck. We looked for about a year before we finally settled on this one, what actually sold us was the car crash related reviews & the side impact features.<br /><br />The kids love the cup holder! It comes off and can be moved to either side which is good if you need to make room in the back or have a smaller car. I have read a few reviews on the recline & belting of this but we have not had any problems with belting it in rear or forward facing. As for the recline.. we have a really good recline with it in my scion xb & my husbands ford truck it may just depend on the vehicle.<br /><br />The only complaint that we (mainly I) really have is that the older models seems to be kind of wider and not as slim as the newer one's we have seen recently in store. I am 5'2, 125 lbs and at times it is kind of annoying to lug from car to car but my husband is not bothered by it.<br /><br />We recently purchased a Britax booster for our oldest and I honestly feel that this is just as good of not better in some aspects as the more popular Britax brand. I have noticed that when we moved the Britax to the center seat (my son get's car sick) that the Safety 1st is so wide that it pushed the Britax over to the side some rather then right perfectly in the center of the seat but that is something we are trying to correct. I don't know about the newer models latch but if they would change them to the kind that just clicks on and also the belt path to where it is in front (like Britax) then I would sale the Britax in a heartbeat!!<br /><br />Overall this is one of the best car seats that we have owned or looked at and I am very confidant that it is very safe should something bad ever happen. We are looking to perchance a newer model of this so that we have a extra for my husbands truck!"

1,5,4,0,2,,"I bought this since I was tired of renting car seats when I traveled for vacation. I could have bought this one a few times over by now.<br />I was mainly looking for something that was safe and lightweight. I can only go by the ratings and other people's reviews for the safety, but I consider this lightweight. There are others that might be considered ultra lightweight, but for me I was able to get this to the airport and to the rental car with minimal effort in a car seat carrying backpack.<br />Installing was not anymore difficult than the car rental seats I had used in the past, but might be tougher if you are used to a more ""deluxe"" seat. The tightening process during install requires you to push down on the seat to make it snug, I typically use my knee in the seat.<br />There are adjustments for belt shoulder height and buckle space which should be done before install, but nothing else.<br />Overall it has already paid for itself. The weight range is wide so I expect to use this for a long time."

1,4,1,0,3,,"Purchased this today from a local chain-store (think of a bow and arrow and you will get it) as we had family visiting the area and needed a child seat quickly. Paid $40 more than Amazon's price, too. While this has some helpful features, it just barely fit my grandchild who weighs 46 lbs and is 48 inches tall. Putting the shoulder straps at the highest level (top slots), he just fit under those straps. The crotch strap was marginal now and by next visit he would need it moved forward too the outer slot. That's what caused me to return this item. To verify that I could adjust that C-strap latter, I tried to relocate it. Well, no matter how hard I tried, even with a pair of heavy duty pliers, I was not able to pull the anchor bracket edgewise up through the narrow lot in the metal and plastic base. Looked like a slam-dump task in their manual, but someone at the factory must have made this slot narrower  (or the anchor thicker) as it just would not come out. The combination of the robust metal anchor and the webbing were just too wide for that slot. Need to look elsewhere for a car seat now."

Of course, this is why it is one of the safest car seats on the market. However, if you plan on buying this and own a small car, smaller SUV, or use multiple car seats in the back, you might have to rethink this seat. For me this seat works perfect because I have it in my Suburban and it's the only car seat I need as my other children are older.<br /><br />1-2 years after I bought this car seat, my children and I were in a wreck that landed us in the ditch upside-down. My son was in this car seat, and he's the only person who came out of this accident without a scratch! No bumps. No bruises. NOTHING. The seat stayed secure and he stayed safe. Since you're not supposed to use car seats after they've been through an accident, we obviously have to buy another one, and you better believe we are going to get him this exact seat again.

0,4,0,0,3,,"Love this car seat. It is the only one I could find here that wasn't hideous, came with a cup holder, wasn't too heavy, was simple to install (for car seat standards) and had straps that weren't tricky to buckle all at a decent price.<br /><br />One thing that bugs me is that there is a ton of extra space at the top that seems unecessary. The instructions tell you that the point where the shoulder straps come out of the seat should be positioned at the same height of your childs shoulders and not dip below this point. This makes it so there is at least 6 inches of extra space above my childs head. The sides still cover my childs head so her head is still protected but just barely. It seems like a pretty big design flaw to have all that unused headrest above their head.<br /><br />We move it from car to car a lot and it really isn't very heavy when you compare it to other brands like a graco I borrowed once. I do find that I have to kneel in the seat while tightening it into place to really get it secure without wobbling. It does make it very secure though and isn't too difficult. I have dealt with worse and this is my first child so I don't have a lot of experience on my side yet,<br /><br />Overall I would definitely recommend. The only cons I have are listed and they are very far from deal breakers especially when compared to the alternatives."

0,5,0,0,3,,"Seem like a decent product, but when we attempted to install as rear facing, it is impossible to get the strap tight enough for these seats to be safe. You have to remove the seat cover to be able to pull on the tightening strap at the appropriate angle to actually tighten it enough, the cover is then physically impossible to properly reinstall once the seat is tight. It's also physically impossible to then get the seat to recline as it's supposed to for safe operation. Maybe if you drive a megavan and have plenty of space to maneuver around the seat it's doable, but for a normal passenger vehicle it is literally physically impossible to safely install this seat rear facing.  Save yourself the headache and buy something else."

0,3,3,0,3,,"I originally bought this for my son to be his only car seat. YAY for trying to save money. When he was born he was 20 inches and 7lbs and didn't fit safely in this seat. We couldn't get the straps small enough no matter how much adjusting we did. NO biggie, we thought, we'll save it for later.<br />Here's where I'm really really torn. This carseat is so easy to install and comfy for long car rides. My son loves it. BUT even at a year, he's maybe 32 inches and 18lbs and we struggle with the straps still. His shoulders seem too narrow for the straps, even when I have the straps below the shoulder (per RF guidelines). Also, we've had a couple of EPIC diapers....and once the poo is out of the diaper, it can drip into the cracks of the carseat and get into the underneath part. EW. We've since purchased a waterproof liner for the bottom, but for a $250+ carseat, I don't want extra hassle for cleaning up messes. Looking into the future with potty training, his bladder will be bigger than the waterproof liner will hold. Yes, I can wash the fabric, but it's also a  hassle. I'm not looking forward to wrangling a wet toddler and having to clean the underneath cavity and fight to strip off the cloth material to wash it.<br /><br />I so so so wanted to love this seat. Its one of the best fits for my car (Volvo XC60) -- it gives the passengers in the back the most seat space and the most leg room for the passenger up front. I love how sturdy it is and how easy it is to install and move from car-to-car. (it's HEAVY but install is a snap).<br /><br />Consider the above if looking at this. If my son were a little bigger, I don't think I'd be as concerned about the straps."

0,5,0,0,3,,"I like that it's rollover tested and well cushioned. But that's all I liked. It was hard to strap down into the car, I needed to get someone else to do it for me, and it took an extensive amount of adjusting. I had to buy an additional tether as the normal one wasn't holding it as well as it should. When reclining, it was either way back or completely upright. Not sure if it was just a defect with mine but no in between meant my son was all the way up or all the way back. It was hard to remove the outer cover for washing and stains easily. Also pretty bulky for my Hyundai Sonata. Although it only took up 1 2/3 seats, so could be worse. The main concern I had, was that the straps are so difficult to adjust in order to tighten or loosen them. Strapping in my kid takes a lot of strength and it sticks a lot. I checked everything, it wasn't twisted, it just takes a lot of force to tighten, resulting in straps that end up hanging off my son's shoulders because it won't tighten any further no matter how hard I pull. He's chunkier, 11months and 24lbs/30&#34;.. I'm hoping mine was just an exception, however, reading other reviews online, not just on here... a lot of people had similar issues with the straps.<br /><br />I ended up ordering a Graco Mileston off the Black Friday sale and will test that out instead.

The adapter that snaps on the bottom for rear facing contains two large plastic protrusions that appear to meant to be wedged between the seat crevice. However, that is not how it works. What is does is force the seat to sit back several inches and recline at an extreme angle. This takes up a lot of precious space. So much that the front seats cannot be placed back far enough to be comfortable to drive. These things are also very sharp and hard and likely to tear or puncture leather if not using some type of protective pad.<br /><br />I have a mid-sized sedan. Not a small car. I thought this compact car seat would be ideal. It doesn't fit in a regular car.

Another great feature is that it is lightweight, which makes a huge difference when you have to carry a big baby around with the seat. The handle provides a firm and comfortable grip for the adult doing the heavy lifting. I also love the pattern and color combination of the fabric. It's stylish, dust resistant, and goes well with almost any car interior. I'm pleased that it looks nicer than in the picture. My baby seems to like the contrasting colors on the inside of the canopy because he keeps looking up with curiosity and even smiled at it several times.<br /><br />Speaking of the canopy, it helps shield the baby from strong sunlight, making it easy for him to open his eyes wide or to doze off to dreamland.

We had to throw it in the trash.  Not happy after spending so much money on what I thought was a quality seat.  I will not buy Britax again."
1,4,0,0,0,,This is a reletively inexpensive car seat. It’s a great 3-1. We’ve used it in 2 of the 3 configurations. Rear facing and forward. I feel like it’s a little cramped for a rear facing seat if your child is tall and light. My sons legs were always touching the rear seat. We had to switch him a bit early because his legs were so cramped. Thankfully he met the weight recommendation at that time. Fairly easy to clean. Everything snaps off to be washable but my kids still made it a mess between washes. Easy to install. Great chair overall

0,4,0,0,5,,Fit perfectly well! Love it!
1,4,1,1,5,Cup Holder,this came in on time and is perfect for my 4 year old son. It also has cup holders which helps a lot! Super easy to use and install
2,3,0,0,3,,I love this carseat. The new latches are awesome. I have 2 in my car and love them so much. One for my 2.5 year old who's still rear facing and one for my 8 month old. 💙

1,4,1,0,3,,Terrible when my toddler falls asleep. His head is all over the place. LOVE the Graco Head Wise 70 Car Seat!
0,4,1,0,3,,"Very safe car seat per crash reviews. Love that it  grows with child, wonderful head support, even a sippy cup holder. Great price at Amazon Deal with Graco rebate. Couldn't ask for more."

1,4,1,1,5,Cup Holder,My preschooler likes being able to see out the window and this seat raises him up just enough to do that. It even matches my vehicle decor.

0,3,0,2,3,,"This car seat is very comfy and I like it, the only problem I've had is that it's rather difficult to pull the bottom strap to tighten the belt around my baby.<br />She's 8 months and 18 pounds, so not a tiny infant... I pull with all my might but there's still a lot of space between her hips/legs and the strap (the infant insert is in place). The top area of the strap seems to be tight enough, but not the bottom. I've tried tightening from the top and pulling on the strap, but it still seems  like there's a lot of room.<br />I called Britax and they told me that since the strap is rather long to roll it around my wrist and pull UP and OUT not to the sides or it'll cause friction against the strap and it'll eventually tear. I will try that today. The strap is really stiff and difficult to pull."
2,3,0,0,1,,I just bought this car seat and I'm totally confused! The crotch buckle is too short. There is 3 different slots to adjust it but the actual length doesn't change. The baby I bought this for is under 20lbs. and very slim but the buckles stick into his legs and looks very uncomfortable and I don't understand how it could possible hold a child up to 65lbs. I'm just disappointed because I have a sports car with very limited space and researched for months trying to find a car seat that was short in height because most on the market are too tall. This car seat is going to have to go back. I don't understand why no one else is having this problem since the seat for good reviews.

1,4,1,2,0,,It came with everything but the cup holder.
0,4,0,0,5,,Installing this car seat was pretty easy/straightforward. Took less time than I anticipated.
1,4,1,0,3,,I purchased this item from AMAZON.COM and received a car seat that was fine for approximately 1 year.  After 1 year the seat-belt buckle broke.  GUESS WHAT??  GRACO DOES NOT MAKE REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR SEAT BELT BUCKLES! So I am stuck with a $200 piece of crap that I was expecting to last for years. 1 Year?<br /><br />THANKS GRACO FOR PROVIDING MY FAMILY WITH CRAP! NEVER AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,3,0,0,3,,Still loving it
0,4,0,0,5,,Very easy to adjust and install!
0,2,1,2,0,,Received 2 of these car seats from our baby registry for our twins. We used them for 11 months and had no issues whatsoever. I loved the fact that this car seat is a lot lighter than all of the other expensive brands we tested. Definitely a plus. And it looks pretty sharp. Easy to connect to strollers and adjust the straps as babies grew. I highly recommend this. Don't see a reason to spend 200$ plus on a carseat when Graco delivers just as good for less.
2,3,0,0,5,,Angosto y espacioso.

0,5,0,0,5,,"We returned a “safety first” brand car seat and splurged for the real deal (Graco). Very glad we did...feels/looks safe, tightens down well, and baby boy looks comfy!!!"
1,3,3,2,3,,Very good product.
1,4,1,1,5,,"The assembly was simple, you just need tough fingers to push in the armrests.<br />Other than that it works great."
1,3,4,2,0,Removable Seat Cushion,"Seat is beautiful and meets all functional expectations. My only comment is that it's difficult to get to the latch to loosen the harness., and I've read that this is an issue with most carseats."
1,4,4,2,3,Adjustable,I have 2 of these for each of my kids and I love them. They are perfect for getting through the airport pain free!  They can also be used as strollers if needed. My kids think the are so fun too.

1,4,4,2,3,Adjustable,My daughter-in law loved this purchase she is going to Australia with her 20 month old daughter and she can use the car seat on the travel cart and not have to carry her through the airports.
1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel",We bought this to use on our trip to Disney and they were perfect. Fairly easy to pack away and inflate. Compact and fit into a back-pack during out time at the park. A must-have when travelling with young kids where you might need to uber or lyft to your destination.
3,5,0,0,1,"Online Chat via ParentLink, Live Video Installation Support, EasyClick LATCH","I love, love, love this car seat!! I have purchased two of these seats. I love everything about it honestly! Easy to install, I feel like the ratchet helps get the seat as tight as possible, comfortable for my son, easy to adjust, but my favorite thing about this seat is how easy it is to take the fabric off and clean it without taking the harness out. And also it’s made in the USA so that is a huge plus for me!"
