You do need to play with it in order to have it secure; I had to roll up a towel to get the angle needed, but that's an issue with the auto manufacturers, not Safety First.

We have it set up as a normal car seat for now, though I did take out the removable extra layer of padding. I didn't even realize that there are little cubby holes in the arm rests for whatever itty bitty toys he brings in the car for entertainment.  And he definitely likes the cup holder.

He's already fallen asleep in it a few times and hasn't had any issues with his head falling forward.  It's a fairly big seat, but surprisingly takes up less space than his old convertible carseat.

0,4,0,0,0,,"The seat is described to be usable either with the harness system or as a booster seat (without harness). For the booster usage, you have to remove the harness. This turns out to be nearly  impossible: one has to reach a “splitter plate” inside the seat construction, which cannot be seen, but only be reached  by one hand, and one has to wiggle two  straps out of this metal plate with one hand in the blind.<br />Even if one would succeed in this nearly impossible task, obviously one will never be able to put the harness harness back in.  So the claim of dual use as harness or booster seat is false; or if the harness is removed with great difficulty, it is for good.<br />For use only with harness it seems OK (seems safe and comfortable), but I wonder who engineered the dual use feature.",146,Yes,"Seat Type: Convertible

Love that it's so slim and easy to carry on the shoulder along with a big diaper bag when I go out with the baby by myself. It's also slim enough to fit in the bottom of the stroller, which makes it so convenient to bring around. The only reason I wouldn't give this a 5 is that the tray is a bit difficult to get on the chair and takes a bit of getting used to.

We have just gotten used to struggling with it a little every time.  When we first got the seats, I had a lot of trouble unbuckling the chest buckle, but either I have learned how to do it or the buckle has relaxed a little, because I only struggled with that for about a week.  Recently we had to wash the cover on one of our seats, and we were able to put it back together with fairly little difficulty.  The size of this seat makes it hard for tall people to ride in the passenger seat in front of it in one of our cars (2009 Subaru Forester), but it's not too bad.  Hopefully our daughter can forward face before we need to extend the head rest further.  We started using this seat when our daughter was about 11 months old and had outgrown her bucket seat by height.  She had no problem with the transition to this seat.

1,4,1,0,3,,"Let me start off by saying, I'm a mom of 16 month old twins and I love these car seats!  I have two of them and for the price, they can't be beat!  My family is on a very tight budget and when it was time to upgrade from the infant carriers to a forward-facing seat, I had some very specific requirements in mind: price, comfort, ability to grow with child, and safety ratings.  Now obviously there are some great car seats on the market, such as Britax, but these seats also cost twice as much ($200-$300), and I could not afford to spend $400 on car seats.  After much research, including going to a local baby store and comparing the padding, weight, etc., these seemed like the best choice.  Not only are they very reasonable in price, but compared to some of the other brands in the same price range (Safety 1st), this was WAY better!  Not only is the cushioning much thicker, but the seat seems roomy and has plenty of room to grow with my boys.  An added bonus is that as long as we don't get into an accident, I can potentially use these seats until the boys are completely out of booster seats (10 years old).  The safety ratings on these seats are pretty good too from places like Consumer Report.  One complaint I've seen in other reviews is that these seats are not at a great angle for your child to sleep, however, I can report that my twins sleep in them all the time and their heads just seem to fall to the side and not at any awkward angles.  Now that I'm going back to work, I will be investing in two more of these seats for our second car, to get the boys to and from daycare.",306,Yes,"Seat Type: forward-facing

1,4,1,2,2,Cup HolderCup Holder,"I originally bought this car seat as an extra for my mom's car because of the affordable price and reviews. I tried to keep my 4 year old in a 5 point harness as long as possible but finally he kept telling me his buckle was &#34;hurting his penis&#34;. I knew at that time, it was time to upgrade! This booster looks great, feels super sturdy and is easy to assemble. The pieces basically just snap together. Not long after I bought this seat my son was in the back seat of my mom's mustang and was rear ended. The car was totaled, but luckily everyone was ok! I love this booster seat and I'd love to credit my son's safety to it. A key part of this I believe is the seat belt guides that properly put the seatbelt across the shoulder position. The seat wipes down easy and the cupholders are a plus. Today, I actually bought a second one of these boosters in red from Toys 'R' Us for $39.99 for our other vehicle. We also use a Graco Turbo Booster which was priced about $49.99 at Toys 'R' Us, but yet I still find myself buying a second Evenflo. As a matter of fact I have bought a total of 5 Evenflo carseats and I always tend to find myself favoring those. I originally started out with a Tribute when my son was little. In our primary vehicle we had a Britax Marathon because it had great safety reviews and I thought because it was more expensive, it must be better. That was the 5 point harness seat that was used from age 2 until 4. After only 2 years of use it seemed like it was falling apart. The interior styrofoam seemed to detach itself from the plastic and the cloth seat was forever coming undone. It also was so large, bulky and heavy it was a pain to take out and move if needed be. My younger son also had a newer Britax Boulevard which practically fell apart as well. We did take off the cloth cover to wash a few times, but with putting it back on a piece of the styrofoam interior ripped off and eventually the whole styrofoam liner started detaching itself again. I ended up throwing out the Boulevard, then giving my younger child the Marathon, and we finally got rid of that and he is in a Evenflo Maestro. I now have 2 Evenflo Maestro's!

0,3,0,0,3,,"We recently purchased the PP Convertible in Paloma and couldn't be more pleased. I HATED the PP infant car seat (seating angle, canopy, base, etc) and went with the Britax Chaperone (LOVED it) so I was a tad hesitant about purchasing the PP convertible despite the stellar reviews. Our 10 month old is almost too long for the Chaperone so we decided to upgrade him to a ""big kid seat"". Luckily we were able to compare the Britax seats the PP non-leatherette seat (Crystal Beige, they didn't have the leatherette in store) at a local store and really loved all the features especially the recline angles and general comfort of the seat, but the thought of cleaning the jersey fabric with our little mess-ball was enough to give me a panic attack. The Paloma fabric is amazing! It's really expensive for a car seat, but spend the extra money for the leatherette fabric. It's definitively worth it and will save your sanity! Just a damp cloth and whatever the little man has caked on it comes right off without any fuss. No removing the fabric (even though you can); literally just wipe it down. Also, I have no problem fitting it in a sedan, CUV and full size SUV. It's smaller than the Chaperone in that sense, but still very roomy for the little guy. It's also the most comfortable seat I have ever seen (obviously haven't tested it myself though) and I have researched them ALL! The little man looks so comfy in it and seems happy to be in his new ""big kid seat"". I also was pleasantly surprised at how much room rear-facing their still is for long legs... Will definitely help keep him rear-facing until closer to 2 than other seats would. Only con besides the expense is the fact there is no canopy, but that is with all the convertibles so not a big deal.

1,3,3,2,3,,"The side wing of the foam headrest is fragile and can break off easily.  I sent Britax 2 complaints via their website since my product was still under warranty.  Although they claim they would respond within 48 hours, they did not honor that commitment.  After 10 days of non-response, I posted a public complaint via their website.  The complaint was reviewed by Britax and the response I got from them was that they could not publish my complaint publicly.  So, after 12 days of waiting for a response, the only response I got was that they wouldn't post my complaint.  I still have not received a response on my original complaint.  I'm posting the full correspondence for the public's benefit:<br /><br />Original Post:<br />Product + Customer Service FAIL!<br />I bought the Boulevard in preparation to transition my son into a toddler car seat. We were switching to Britax from a competitor brand, which we used as the infant car seat, because of a friend's recommendation. After a few months of use, the side wing of the foam head rest snapped off in the action of putting my son into the seat. I would have expected this piece to be able to withstand the repetitive motion of moving back and forth. As ANY parent would know, putting a child into a car seat is NOT like an adult settling into his favorite armchair: sometimes the angle is awkward, sometimes the child resists, sometimes the child stands. When the side wing snapped, there wasn't any particular struggle and nothing noticeably harsh and it clearly gave out of repetitive (though ROUTINE) use. I contacted Britax about this July 4th. Given that this was a holiday, I didn't expect an answer and gave them 3 days. On the evening of the 7th, I sent another question/complaint through their website. Since I still have not received a response (now July 12th), not even an auto-reply, I thought this warranted a public post so that future potential customers could be aware. On a side note, though no less important for safety conscious parents, in my question to Britax, I also mentioned that the toddler shoulder belts were unevenly tensioned when I tightened them around my son's shoulder. Even though I would pull the strap to tighten the belt, my son's left shoulder strap would still be loose while his right shoulder strap was tight. There was no obvious snag when I checked the back of the car seat. This issue was present from Day 1 of using the Boulevard. I continued using it because I could set the chest buckle higher to minimize the &#34;give&#34; in the looser shoulder strap.<br /><br />Britax Response:<br />Our staff has read your review and values your contribution even though it did not meet all our website guidelines.

I would describe this as an OK budget option, but if you can, spring for a better quality car seat. This is the thing that will protect your child in the event of a collision, so if you can save up for a better seat, please do.<br /><br />Our 11-month-old was very unhappy getting fitted in this, he hated the position, and as others have pointed out it will be hard for him to sleep in here comfortably (which is also dangerous if his head is not positioned properly).<br /><br />As others pointed out, this thing feels flimsy. There are exposed parts in the back that rattle around a lot, regardless of whether there's a kid in it. It's mostly the parts that interface to raise and lower the back, so you might be able to wrap some electrical tape around the metal pieces to dampen the sound, but that seems like a silly solution to a sub-par design.<br /><br />The LATCH straps. Where to start? Why did they even bother? Chicco has a latch strap with nice plastic-coated attachment points that resemble a seatbelt clipping in. This thing just has metal hooks on the end with a flimsy little retainer piece. Then you have to awkwardly try to pull it like a seatbelt to get it tight enough. All of my body weight and all of my strength trying to tighten the strap was futile, because ultimately you're pulling a strap perpendicular to the direction that you need to tighten it.<br /><br />I tightened this as much as I could and still had a good 6"" of play on the front of the seat -- way more than is safe. It would have been far better to drop the LATCH system entirely and require the much more complicated (read: likely to be done incorrectly) seat belt installation.<br /><br />Back in the box this went.

1,4,1,0,3,,"This carseat has some good features, but overall, I hate this thing with every fiber in the fabric of my being.  If I had access to ballistics, I'd blow this thing up. But alas, I'm a pretty wimpy soccer mom armed only with a light sabre and a 12 pack of juice boxes, so a lousy review is all I have.<br /><br />The good: The fabric is nice and cleans up easily.  I don't generally let my children eat in the car, but if I did, I don't think the fabric would stain. The seat feels well made, with solid materials and heavy plastics that instill a sense of confidence. The cup holders and the ingenious toy hiding cubby are awesome. That's it. That's all the good there is. I have not had issues with the buckle. It may be because I do not let the children eat the car.<br /><br />The bad: This thing is heavy. That's not always bad, but it's almost unmanageable. I have Recaro seats that I like a lot. They're heavy, too, but somehow they don't seem as bad. The seat is very hard to install, with old school latch connectors that are nearly impossible to attached to the rear deck hooks in a sedan. It takes me almost 15 minutes to install this seat properly using the latch connectors.  I have yet to try installing it with the seat belt - it may take away some of the intense vitriol I feel for this seat.<br /><br />The ugly: My son is 5 and 37 lbs. He cannot get himself into this seat in my relatively easy access VW Passat. The seat is &#34;bucket&#34; style, with a considerable incline, even after adjustment.  Because of the incline, the buckle is always facing the child's posterior. As a result, he's always sitting on it and you have to reach under his hind quarters to reach the buckle. I've read other reviews, looked at the instructions and researched YouTube, but the crotch strap is surprisingly short with an insufficient number of slots. It's ok for a younger child, but as your child gets older it's an awkward exchange to get him in and out of the seat. It's actually an episode to get my son into the seat. He cries, complains, and begs me to loosen the straps. The seat hurts his butt, and as a smaller kid, he finds it difficult to overcome the incline in order to get himself out of the car. Combine that with the never ending winter and mornings consistently in the 20+ below 0F range up here in the tundra, it takes unreasonably long to get a kid comfortably and properly into this seat. I gave up and put him in a belt tensioning booster. This thing wasn't worth it, and after less than a year, I kicked it to the curb.<br /><br />Yes, I know, they should be in a 5 point until they're 32 because it's just that much safer. Yes. I agree. If you have a 7 or 8 year old that is happily in a 5 point harness, you're clearly a better parent than I who has exceptionally gifted children. For us mortals who need to balance practicality with safety, this seat just doesn't cut it. I replaced it with a Recaro seat that I am very happy with. The 5 year old agrees.<br /><br />Clearly, this is a very popular seat with a whole host of parents that think this bad boy is the cat's meow. Frankly, it's the worst $150 I've ever spent. I just hate it that much. Do your research, test it out.  Maybe it will work for you.

It also takes up quite a bit more room in the car than I imagined - again, I'm sure this is not an issue limited to this particular seat, but to the entire rear-facing car seat universe. Outside of that, I can't complain too much. It is a bit tricky to get the seatbelt harness to unlatch once the lil one is strapped in. It feels like I have to push way too hard on the button to get it to release, and means that I am putting pressure on her when I do so - even with a hand (or a few fingers rather) between the buckle and my baby. I'm working on technique to help get around that issue.<br /><br />The ease of snapping it in and out of the base is unbelievable though. So easy. ONce you get the base secured that is. That may take a little bit of trail and error depending on your vehicle and whether or not you plan to use a seat cover to protect your car seat's surface from the bottom of the base (which we did on my wife's car, but not on mine). Still, pretty easy to get that taken care of, just means you need to check it from time to time to make sure it has't compressed the car seat cover enough to make the base a tad bit loose (has never gone from green to red - but has show a red line from time to time on the &#34;tightness indicator&#34;).<br /><br />Installing this in my car, however, was a nightmare. MY fault for driving a Mustang. To all you out there with a car that has little to no back seat room, rest assured the seat will fit - although very very tight - and to be honest, probably not meeting ALL of the manufacturer's suggested space between baby seat and back of front seat requirements if you are trying to have an adult riding shotgun comfortably. But installing the base will be a major pain in the a double-s because you have virtually no room to maneuver yourself on top of the damn thing to make sure it is secured tightly (ie - to make that &#34;tightness indicator&#34; go from red to green). As I said, it can be done, just be patient and do some stretching before you try to get it in there because you're going to have to play contortionist to apply the pressure needed to lock everything in place.<br /><br />But back to the good stuff. It's also very nice that you can rock the seat when you put it down. So if baby gets a little fussy, you can start to gently, or quickly if you wish, rock her. And you can do so with your hand or your foot. Convenient. But that's, again, probably something most if not all baby seats will do.

I looked at this car seat first time in target. It was designed very strong and I liked this will save much space in my car.  I ordered it in Amazon in Amazon day to save a lots of money. This was a great and very comfortable car seat that can match the Doona my daughter used to sit. She is happy and calm. Rear facing has two options of tilting and front facing has two more options. I didn’t try front facing yet , but looking at it how well engineered this I’m confident enough when a turn it to front facing it will have the same comfort and ease of use.  Overall if your looking to save space in your car there is no any other product can come close to this. Mag in future big as of now so far the best I found and happy with the product!!!

The closest we ever came to a nice ride was if he was in the front seat with the airbag off - not ideal.<br /><br />A more experienced mom suggested I look into a convertible seat. Another experienced parent suggested Britax. I took my son to Baby r Us and sat him in every single car seat. I tried to pay attention to angle and cushion and how he responded. He seemed happy in this one. My 5 month old is quick to let you know when he is not comfortable.<br /><br />He also liked another popular brand so we had to choose. This one just looked nicer. It seemed more low key then the sticker filled second choice<br /><br />This car seat was easy to install, angled nicely for a baby with reflux and for the first time we drove home Sunday night with  no baby screaming, no stops on the highway to cuddle and calm him down.

I did a ton of research first and decided to give this seat a try - at that time my son was 3.5 years old and was forward facing.  The install on this seat is not what I would consider difficult -I read all the instructions and was able to get it installed nice and tight into our 2010 Toyota Highlander in about 10 mins.<br /><br />Update - my son has been using this seat for nearly 3 years and it is great.  It is made of high quality materials and is built to last - I've washed the cover a ton and it still looks like new.  He loves the seat and says it is very comfortable. I recently purchaused a second one for my 15 month old and have recommended this seat to many freinds.<br /><br />The one downside worth mentioning: It is heavy AF.  It does fold flat and fits in the car seat travel bag nicely but it is NOT lightweight and is a bit of a pain to lug through an airport if you are traveling and gate checking the seat or installing on the plane.,216,Yes,"Seat Type: forward facing

I was planning a trip with my 5 year old and the thought of having to bring a booster seat everywhere seemed like a nightmare. We were planning on taking a lot of Lyft's and Uber's and needed something compact to store while we walked around.<br /><br />After using it for 6 days it was extremely easy to carry around. It deflated enough to fit in a small child size backpack and light enough for my child to carry around. It took seconds to inflate and only a few seconds to buckle. Going forward I am definitely recommending this to anyone who has to travel with kids or anyone who needs extra space in their backseat.

My son could hardly fit into the base with his coat on and everything...the arm rests were in his way and the base is just an odd shape...almost more circular. We took it out and put it into another vehicle for my smaller child but we have to really take our time to get her into it properly. She wouldn't be able to get in it alone.

1,4,1,0,3,,"I would absolutely rank this seat higher than I did, except for one big problem: the buckle.<br /><br />The set itself is well constructed, it's a good looking seat (as far as car seats go) it's not too big to leave room for other kids in the back seat, but it has one glaring flaw: the BUCKLE.<br /><br />The buckle is really difficult to unsnap, some might say impossible. Neither of the kids' grandmothers can depress the button well enough to unsnap the straps. If you have caregivers who will be using this seat with arthritis, forget it, get a different seat. I can barely get the buckle to work it's so tough.  If you're putting your kid in and out of this seat many times a day, having to deal with that buckle is a dealbreaker. I wish I'd know that this was a problem so I could weigh the pros with that huge functional con. You can read other reviews that state the same thing: Some kids are getting stuck in their seats because the buckle will not budge, and this appears to be a problem the company is AWARE of, but is not fixing.<br /><br />Also, the straps that go around the child's legs leave very little room once buckled in the seat. The buckle is way too far back on the seat, meaning it digs into your kid's crotch.

2,4,0,0,1,,"This carseat is terrible. I had a different car seat on my registry and someone purchased me this seat instead, which was the worst decision anyone has ever made.  First off, it's VERY difficult to install.  The latch strap is impossible to tighten and the shape of the sides makes it very difficult to put your weight into the seat to tighten it.  The belt or latch strap threads under the seat, and the seams on the fabric there are so sharp they have actually cut my hand trying to thread the belt.  The positioning of the cupholders on the sides means that the seatbelt install pulls up that side of the carseat making it crooked.<br /><br />Once (if) you manage to get the thing installed correctly, it doesn't get any better.  The pieces at the top used to adjust the back height RATTLE constantly while driving.  It's so aggravating.  We had to keep a towel up there to stop the constant noise.  Not only that, but they're SHARP!  If you ever turn around to pat your kid's hair or hand them something, watch out for those things.  They've left a massive scratch up my arm from getting too close.<br /><br />Finally, the straps on the seat are always getting twisted.  As if it's not difficult enough to get your toddler in and out of the the carseat, the openings in the clips are just large enough that the straps are always twisting around.<br /><br />I would highly recommend against this seat.

1,4,1,1,0,,"(Edited on 3/31/2018 to raise the rating from 4 to 5 stars. The lap belt guides do not move in on their own anymore on the newer models!!! A quick recap: this is basically a seatbelt repositioner. A &#34;regular&#34; booster's purpose is to raise the child higher so the seatbelt fits better, and the mifold is a different way of doing it. It may not be the most comfortable seat, but the mifold offers convenience and compactness without sacrificing safety. If the child is too wiggly, this isn't the best product, but then such a child should be in a 5-point harness. Be aware and reasonable about the product's limitations, and you'll be satisfied. You can disregard the below review's portion about the lap belt guides moving in, but I left it in, just so you know there may be different versions.)<br /><br />******************************<br />(Original review)<br />I've been following this product since 2015, participated in the company's crowdfunding and have been eagerly waiting for my mifold to arrive for months. I haven't received that one yet, but imagine my surprise and delight when a mifold showed up in the Vine program, so I quickly grabbed one.<br /><br />This is such a brilliant concept. The purpose of a traditional booster seat is to raise the child up a few inches so the car's seatbelt, designed to fit an adult, can be safely used by a smaller-sized human - the lap belt should not sit at a child's waist. What the mifold does is to bring down the seatbelt to properly restrain a child. Again, brilliant.<br /><br />Part of finding a good booster seat involves how well it fits into your car's rearseat design, like the slope, shape, etc... The best booster seat is the one which fits your car properly. Because the seat portion can bend in half, this allows more flexibility in the type of backseats a booster seat can be placed. The mifold is also great for a larger child who sits too high for a booster seat but sits too low for a car's seatbelt during that in-between stage. It's not as if every child needs to be raised up about 4-5 inches for a proper fit.<br /><br />On the flip side, the mifold may not work as well for shorter children. Since a car's backseat's depth is most likely deeper than the length of a shorter child's upper thighs, the child's legs would be sticking out straight when used properly. Okay, fine, but if the child wants to bend his/her legs at the knees, the child may sit closer to the edge of the backseat, which will make the butt slide farther away from the crease of the back and possibly make the child slouch. Again, depends on the car's backseat and the child.<br /><br />Then, its size... OH, ITS SIZE!!! If you're short on backseat width and have a smaller child who doesn't need the entire width of a traditional booster seat, the mifold will give you those few precious inches for a better 3-across. For the caretakers of 3 kids who feel like their non-minivans/large SUVs won't accommodate multiple child restraint seats but can't afford to buy a larger vehicle, the mifold may save your budget.<br /><br />It's a bit heavier than it looks. The seat bottom is rather firm and small - it's a little over 8&#34; by 8&#34; when unfolded. I was concerned this would be too uncomfortable for the occupant, but it wasn't, possibly because a car's rearseat is very cushioned, allowing the mifold to sink into the cushion. An adult weighing a bit over 100lbs tried it for testing purposes only, and the adult felt fine.<br /><br />The width can be adjusted out to 13.5&#34; internally at the upper thighs, then tapering to a width of 13.25&#34; closer to the knee - the lap belt guides angle in a bit. The red lap belt guides should not be so narrow they touch the occupant.<br /><br />I'd give this 5 stars for ingenuity and practicality, but there are a couple of issues:<br /><br />1. The lap belt guides move in too easily. Pulling them out requires using a couple of tabs, but pushing them in requires virtually no effort. It's very easy to push in the lap belt guides. I think the intent was to make it easier for the child to adjust the lap belt guides' width, but it would've been better to make the child adjust the width to lock in the position before placing it on the car's backseat. If there is some quick, jerky movements while riding, the booster seat may shift. Also, another person sitting next to a mifold user can accidentally push in the lap belt guide. To be fair, I haven't had the lap belt guides get moved yet while in the car, but I can foresee how this may be a problem when things get bumped at a bad time.<br /><br />2. The shoulder belt guide/clip is difficult to open initially. I can open it since I'm an adult who had some practice, but younger kids will need help, along with adults who may not be familiar with the mifold, like the driver for a class field trip. I don't know if the shoulder belt guide mechanism has to lock for the mifold to work properly. Other booster seats have shoulder belt guides that let the user slide in the vehicle's shoulder belt and leave at that, though having it lock does prevent the vehicle's shoulder belt from sliding out.<br /><br />Other quirks that don't affect the star rating:<br />- The shoulder belt guide/clip is made of plastic. It seems durable, and I hope it doesn't break or get loosened after repeated use.<br />- There are lots of sewn-on tags and labels. Since (I assume) these are regulatory requirements, there's nothing mifold can do about them, considering the lack of available space for such items due to the compact size of the mifold.<br />- The manual can be stored in a slot incorporated into the mifold, but it's a little difficult to get the manual in and out - be sure to leave the manual sticking out a bit so it can be removed easier.<br /><br />It's obvious a lot of thought went into designing this. With the mifold, there's no excuse for not using a booster seat, even when traveling. Besides the mechanisms of the guides, I love this product. I hope this gains more popularity so the difficulty and unfamiliarity of using the mifold disappears. Or, maybe the next generation of mifold will improve it. I don't know if this can replace traditional booster seats for some but for traveling and carpools, this is practically a must-have safety item without compromising convenience. In the meantime, I continue to wait for the mifold I ordered via crowdfunding while being grateful for the opportunity to receive one for review - many thanks to Jon Sumroy, the mifold team and Amazon's Vine program.",1168,Yes,"Seat Type: booster seat, traditional booster seat, seatbelt repositioner

0,7,0,2,3,,"Why is choosing a carseat so difficult and emotionally fraught?! We kept our slim, average-height daughter rear-facing in her Graco Snugride 35 bucket seat until she grew too tall for the straps (22 months, 22 lbs), then started looking for a convertible seat for her to use for the next several years.  After subscribing to Consumer Reports and reading everything I could find on the internet, I narrowed it down to this seat and the Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 based on safety features and user reviews, considering ease of use, comfort, and vehicle fit.  I just couldn't decide, but I knew we would want two seats (one for my CRV and one for my husband's Tahoe), so we bought one of each.  The Maxi-Cosi went in my car, the Britax went in the Tahoe.  I really like them both (and my daughter has no complaints) but I like the Maxi-Cosi better for the following reasons:<br />--the fabric feels and looks nicer and like it will be cooler in the summer (we live in TX)<br />--the seat feels much more cushiony<br />--the &#34;wings&#34; around her head offer significantly more coverage in case of a crash. They also give her head more support. (I was afraid she wouldn't like them because she can't really turn her head to the side, but she doesn't seem to mind so far.)<br />--the Maxi-Cosi has a nice cupholder and more room for her toys to sit with her.<br />--the Britax between-the-legs buckle is strangely positioned -- she's almost sitting on it.<br /><br />Both seats are attractive and fit well (enough) in the vehicles rear-facing. We have only one child, so she sits in the middle seat.  If there were more than one seat, it might start to be an issue in my CRV, but she will be forward-facing before we have another kid, so I'm not too concerned.<br /><br />The Britax does win, hands-down, in one area so far: cleaning.  The M-C seat has to be taken apart to get the cover off, and then has to be hand-washed (what were they thinking?!).  The Britax seat cover comes off easily and washes well.  I know this because it got thoroughly broken in with a spilled cup of milk AND A bout of diarrhea on its very first outing -- UGH!  We were grateful to be able to yank the seat cover off with no trouble, hose it down, and toss it in the washer.  The trickiness of washing it is a definite downside of the Maxi-Cosi, but we're hoping to minimize the issue by not allowing her to eat or drink in that seat. So the fancy cupholder is just for toys, but that still comes in handy.<br /><br />The bottom line is, both seats are terrific and seem very safe, and I would recommend either.",469,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear Facing, Convertible

The Carseat attachments for the popular UPPABABY stroller are not secure and this seat moves AT LEAST 3 inches forward and backwards. Yes it does not fall but it doe snot create any confidence. ThE STRAPS.. oh the tightening straps . As you might have read countless other times. The straps get caught on the underside of the plastic bottom and you CANNOT pull them tight from the front of the unit. WE HAVE TO take the seat out of the car to tighten the straps. They get tangled underneath EVERY time. It sucks. I have had to rethread the straps at least 15 times and I have to tighten him in it outside the car. Removing the seat from the car is also really hard as you have to tilt the seat to the side and pull it sideways as the seat gets caught if you try to pull it from any other angle. The release buttons for the stroller  are so deep and hidden on either side that you need 2 hands to undo the buttons even though you need another hand to lift the chair!!!<br /><br />FINALLY as others have mentioned the carry bar clicks very loud and will wake any baby when you adjust it ( both hands are needed once again) . I realize this may be a safety thing to register that it is locked  but the click is so loud it will wake any baby and dog sleeping nearby. I don't normally write many reviews but I just wanted to pass the word. It's a relatively affordable chair that is built well and cozy BUT you cannot loosen and tighten this 90% of the time.

My second child will be in need in of a convertible seat soon and I will not be buying a second NextFit.  While it does the job and is a solid and good seat, there are enough irritants with it that are causing me to pass a second time.<br /><br />- It is HEAVY. Changing cars is almost unbearable and my parents refuse to do it because it is too heavy for them.  It is very awkward getting it into the back of sedan like vehicles, all around a massive pain to move.  If you NEVER or very rarely change it out this might not be a huge factor for you, but it is a bear.<br /><br />- When rear facing, it can be really hard to tighten the straps because it is SO close to the seat.  This might be the case with other car seats too, but my parents especially complain a lot.  I can do it, but I don't love it and I have to use a lot of force. Which leads to the next issue.<br /><br />- My current seat is actually a replacement from Chicco (INCREDIBLE customer service) because the plastic casing around the orange button to loosen the straps kept popping out and eventually the plastic broke because to tighten the straps you have to pull up instead of at the same angle as the strap given how close the strap is to the seat.  (kinda hard to explain)  Well this same issue has happened on my current seat.  I cannot tell you how annoying it is trying to tighten the straps and the whole plastic bit pops off.<br /><br />- The button to raise and lower the headrest which also adjusts the straps seems a little flimsy.  Every now and then when my 3.5 yr old gets into the seat I notice that the headrest has gone back down.  It takes a bit of wiggling and jiggling to get it lock again at the correct height.<br /><br />- It's hot.  The seat doesn't breath well. It's really cushiony which is nice, but at the cost of being hot. Fortunately my daughter doesn't overheat too much, but my son always is really hot in his carseats, so this seat definitely won't work for him.<br /><br />- Even with the strap covers, my daughter gets lines and irritants in her neck.  Maybe I'm overzealous in my tightening, but I do feel bad after a long ride and I see her neck.<br /><br />- All the inclines seem kind of a waste.  I can only have the seat included at 1 or 2 rear facing for it to be in the correct level.  Any other inclines take the seat out of the level area.  Not sure about forward facing as I haven't switched around to that yet.<br /><br />All the pros that people mention are true, but for the above reasons I won't get another one.",512,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear Facing, Forward Facing, Convertible

I didn't hesitate to buy the Marathon G4 for my wife's Mazda CX-7 while I continued using the infant carrier in my car.<br /><br />When the time came to buy a car seat for my car, I test fit the Marathon in the back seat.  It's tight back there to begin with so I didn't think it would fit but it did-barely.  The front passenger's seat in my car would be useless with the Marathon installed.  The Marathon is taller and doesn't seem to tilt as much as I wanted so that the seat was adjusted properly and an adult would fit in the front passenger's seat.

4,2,0,0,0,,"The pros: The color is great! It is very comfortable for the baby - he actually smiles really big every single time I put him in here. It has a very narrow profile so it helped me get three seats in the back seat of a sedan. I love the strap height adjuster in the back. It makes it super easy to raise the strap height as they grow without having to take the straps apart. The canopy is nice and large and provides a lot of coverage from the sun.<br /><br />The cons: The handle is very difficult to adjust. The buttons are super hard to push down in order to tip it into a different position. I struggle with it every single time, and my wrists and hands were really sore when we first got the seat. The seat is heavy and awkward to carry a baby around in - though I think all bucket seats are like this, which is why I don't often carry them around in the seat. The buckle is a puzzle piece, so you have to piece it together before putting both pieces into the crotch part of the buckle. This is really ridiculous as the only reason for it I can figure out is that it is preventing the child from being able to buckle themselves into the seat - it still releases just as easily. I'm not sure why we would want to prevent baby's from buckling themselves in, and none I know of would ever master this skill while still in this seat anyway, so every time I have to do the annoying puzzle piece buckle I wonder what they were thinking with that one. Also, the base doesn't fit in my car very well. It seems to sit not level from left to right and I try adjusting it all the time with no success. Without a pool noodle it sits very upright and there wasn't enough room to adjust the base so that didn't happen. With a pool noodle it sits at a better angle, but I'm having the off level issue then.

It's super slim, so it almost fits 3 across, but even in the van I would struggle to go three. It has two and would be a tight fit on three for me. The lack of a base just caused a headache. I have a newer 2019 Chevy Equinox, as well as a 2013 minivan and it is not working in either vehicle. I thought that I'd give it a go in my Dad's 05 Silverado and see if it was just something with the way the seats were in my car, versus perhaps and older vehicle and it still didn't work correctly.<br /><br />I followed all of the instructions, watched videos, and even resorted to taking it to the fire house for a check. The seat just does not want to stay on the level line. My niece is only 23 lbs, well within the range of the 5-40 lbs recommended for the rear facing option. I worked with the firehouse to get it level and then put her in it. I did a few test laps out back and sure enough, after a few bumps and driving around the building, when I'd get out the level line would be off. It has a suggestion in the booklet about using a towel or rolled up blanket, but that still didn't fix the issue.<br /><br />The seat is cute, and it does work when flipped around, though. I tested it out forward facing and it stays where it should and is leveled out. It's kind of frustrating after going through all the steps. What I ultimately decided to do was take my nephews EvenFlow convertible seat and flip it to rear facing for my niece and then flipped this one forward for my nephew. He doesn't seem to mind the Miney seat and once they're both big enough, I can flip the seats back around and use this for my nieces seat.

I have a 2007 Subaru Impreza wagon; the back seat is not deep by any means, and in addition to that, there is really no leg room in the rear (I'm 5'8&#34; and my husband is 6'). It is narrow and not deep at all. I was amazed at how much room I had in my car after it was installed.<br /><br />2.) Using an infant seat in conjunction<br />With my first daughter, an infant car seat could only fit in the center seat, with both seats pushed up a few inches. We dealt with that with our daughter, however, we are expecting baby number 2! I needed a solution, otherwise I would have to trade in my car. There was no car seat that had the dimensions to be able to squeeze next to an infant car seat in the middle with the exception of this one. We could literally put 3 of these in our back seat with room to spare, which is incredible.<br /><br />3.) Rear-facing recline degree/space<br />We have installed it behind the passenger seat as forward-facing (an infant car seat fitting perfectly beside it), however it would definitely fit rear-facing if we needed it to. If you're going to use it rear-facing, it does not recline NEAR as far back as I'm used to with other convertible car seats.<br /><br />4.) Comfort/value/price<br />Besides the fact that it is downright adorable, I got it for $169.99 which is the cheapest I've seen the car seat on Amazon and Babies-R-Us and Target.com for months. I had to buy it then, especially with it being Prime eligible. It seems very comfortable and padded and the material looks durable. It is supposed to be incredibly easy to throw in the wash, which is why I didn't mind going with the light lime color.<br /><br />5.) Installation<br />Installation was easy...says hubby.

I've heard if you have problems with it not fitting snugly, to try using a  piece of pool noodle (or call Combi directly and they will ship you out something similar).<br /><br />Overall, it seems to be a wonderful, thoughtful product at a great price.

Me being the prepared person figured we should install car seat before baby arrival. Good thing we tried.

The instructions clearly state the base of the car seat should not overhang the edge of the seat by more than 3 inches.

1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel","We needed a narrow booster seat to fit three across in our car. We use this for our eldest, who at 10 is about to graduate from boosters altogether. He began using it at about age 7. We don't need height from a booster for him, just the shoulder belt positioner. The seat belts in our backseat are really high, so he still needs that feature for now. I recommend this seat for older, bigger, mature kids who don't need seat height or a reminder to sit right, just a better fit to the lap and/or shoulder seat belts. It's also great for difficult three-across installations, travel, and carpools.<br /><br />I think they may have fixed this since we bought ours, but we do find the lap belt guides tricky to thread. It took awhile before my son could do that part himself.<br /><br />I also find the expiration date of four years to be on the low end for car seats. Then again, for the price, you get a lot of use out of it.<br /><br />It's a very handy seat for travel, as we've recently found. You deflate it and toss it into whatever bag is handy — easy peasy. Blow it back up at your destination, and you're good to go. The only downside is how mucky the back of a seat gets in the car, and then you have to put your mouth on it, ha ha. This seat would also work well for carpool kids and ride-share travel and friends visiting and the like, assuming the users fit the size requirements. (With the 40-pound minimum, my skinny middle child at nearly 7 can still not use this seat.)<br /><br />Comfort-wise, my son complained at the downgrade in comfort level from his previous Britax front-facing car seat. However, he stopped complaining after a few days, and he's been fine with the BubbleBum ever since. It doesn't have bells and whistles, such as arm rests or cupholders, which is what helps keep it narrow and easy to fit into a small space. My son's on the larger end of the percentile calculators for height and weight, and he does fine with it. I think his thighs spill over the sides a bit, but he doesn't seem to mind that. It's basically like sitting on a regular seat in the car with a tiny bit of air cushion. So it's not plush, but they'll be fine once they get used to it. My son's not prone to peer pressure around this issue, but I'll point out that it's a nice option for older kids who don't want an obvious booster but still need that belt positioning help.<br /><br />All in all, the BubbleBum has worked nicely for us, and we'd get another one if our younger kid ever gets above 40 pounds!",474,Yes,"Seat Type: booster seat

My sister recommended the Frontier 85, which she had bought.  After reviewing everything I could get my hands on, we purchased 2 of the Frontier 85's (Cowmooflage and Pink Sky).  Our daughter (4 years old, 42.5"" and 40lbs) loves the color's and I find the fabric very nice, not too keen on the gray on the bottom of the Pink Sky though, the feel of the fabric isn't nice.  At first they looked confusing to install, after reading the instructions twice, I had it in the Yukon in under 20 minutes, with my 4 year old's ""help"" and with the LATCH and tether.  Car seat back is nice and tight to the truck seat, tether is nice and tight, that car seat is not going anywhere.  Oh, and our Yukon has the captain's chairs NOT the bench.<br /><br />The car seats were shipped separately and arrived 4 days apart, so this morning we moved the one in the Yukon to the Ram and put the new one in the Yukon.  PIECE OF CAKE for the Ram, we can't use the tether due to the rear seat back not moving forward, but once the LATCH was tightened, that seat doesn't move an inch, and there is no gap between the bottom of the seat and the back of the trucks' seat.  I installed the new seat in the Yukon next.  Total time for both trucks 12 minutes.<br /><br />I was hesitant on the single pull LATCH tightening, but I LOVE IT.  I found it so much easier to get the seat tight, because you can't run out of strap to tighten, which was the problem I had with the Boulevard in the Yukon, I had it as tight as it would go, but is still had a little give.  The new LATCH is completely locked down, and once you feed the tightening strap through the slip, you get the angle you were always trying to get on the dual strap models, and it just locks the seat in.<br /><br />We found that even though this seat is bigger in size then the Boulevard, it fits better in the RAM.  The back of the car seat doesn't rest against the back window like the Boulevard, there is actually a 2-3 inch clearance.<br /><br />Our daughter loves the seats, they give her plenty of space, she loves the cup holders.  We love the extra padding Britax put on these seat, the lighter weight, the 5 point harness up to 85lbs was a huge selling point for us, and all the safety features and standards that Britax is known for.

Nice and narrow.<br />- Child sits deep in the seat. I feel like this one provides a lot of side impact protection. Also, easier to keep a child rear facing, because their legs are not bunched up against the seat.<br />- Rated for rear tethering, which very few seats allow.

0,7,0,0,0,,"I ordered Graco SnugRide for a baby shower present through a Target Gift Registry, processed through Amazon.  It was shipped to me in the same thin single-ply cardboard box you buy it in stores.  The box is very large and flimsy.  It arrived with the box seriously dented on all sides, hardly worthy of presentation.  But worse, when I opened it up, I found a 2 inch white stress line in the plastic, where apparently the beige plastic of the car seat (which seems fairly thin) was over stressed during shipping.  The box had no padding inside whatsoever, the car set is simply wrapped in a plastic cover.  I've done a lot of shipping, and I know you have to have 2 inches or more of padding on all sides, or double boxing, and a box this large should be double corrugated for strength.<br /><br />It was convenient to be able to return the car set at a local Target store, but I was not refunded the shipping cost of $15, even though it was very clearly the faulty packaging by Amazon/Target that caused the unit to get damaged.  I was also informed that Target does not carry the item in their stores, so it is only available through mail order.  I'm going to try to find some other local seller.<br /><br />The Super Saurus model in the Gift Registry that I ordered is apparently in the premium line of SnugRide car seats, having the ""GracoPedic"" foam padding for comfort (in addition to the EPS which is in all Snug Rides for safety).  I wouldn't buy one of these without the GracoPedic foam.  Baby should not be resting on the hard plastic (oh, well, maybe the plastic isn't that hard anyway).  I think they should all come with the extra GracoPedic foam (though reportedly it doesn't hold up to washing), or at least it should be mentioned on the box.  But it didn't mention the GracoPedic foam on the box, I only learned it from a review, and it is hard to tell otherwise.<br /><br />For a top-rated product like this, I was not impressed by the thin plastic construction, which looks and feels cheap and flexible. more like a toy than a car safety device.  And if you look at the 1-star reviews, these things can break in normal use, which I don't find reassuring.  But I'm not sure what if anything is actually better than this from a safety perspective, as long as you replace it at the first sign of damage so it doesn't actually come apart in use.",432,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear Facing

You follow minimal instructions on the car seat itself. Days later I found a QR code on the box that I can scan to open the manual online. Initially when installing no where told me to use the anchor that attaches to the top back part of the car seat... I had to do lots of video searching to finally find someone installing using that. Our car seat seemed like it wasn’t secure and I figured that was why but I couldn’t figure out how or where to attach the anchor. Lastly, when installed the car seat as it comes it takes so up much room. My husband has a full sized truck and I as the front passenger had to push the seat all the way to the dash and raise the back of the seat to more than 90 degrees for the car seat to fit behind me. We finally figured out(after much video searching) that you can purchase and angle adjuster that helped with this issue a lot. A little disappointed it wasn’t included initially.

However, if they check your carry-on through to baggage claim because of a lack of storage space on the aircraft you will be carrying the carseat and loose toddler around the airport--yikes.<br /><br />Here are my other downsides:<br /><br />(1) It puts significant wear and tear on your baggage, especially if you try to push, rather than pull the bag. Baggage is not designed for this use. One of our baggage handles died this way.

0,2,1,0,1,,"We bought this car seat from a different source after finding a better sale price, but thought I would share my thoughts here.<br /><br />Great, quality car seat that I felt met my high safety expectations, after a different high-end brand let me down (having had recalls regarding their China-made plastic and removal of their anti-rebound bar design in the new bases). I read many safety websites and comparisons regarding this car seat and other competitors', but seeing the actual results of the crash safety tests and the amount of G-Force transferred to the baby (this car seat rated among the best for dispersal of G-Force and impact energy) I felt happy going with it. The fabric looks like it will breath well and I'm impressed by the different inserts and quality of construction. The base is also narrower so it has a better fit if you want to try doing the three-across car seat setup in your truck or car. My husband loves that the seatbelt lockoff is a big panel that easily pushes down instead of those flimsy narrow lockoffs you see on other car seats. I love the European belt routing if you're installing without the base. Honestly, it's everything I've come to expect from a modern car seat.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The shoulder pads - someone else mentioned that the velcro is sewn on the inside where the fabric meets the harness belts, and it is still this way with the one we purchased. It catches on EVERYTHING, including the harness belts themselves at times. We tried different dolls and stuffed animals in the car seat for fun, my children enjoy it, but I have to be careful they don't get caught by this velcro. I can foresee issues with this and will probably remove them and use a different brand or something. They are great material other than this one design flaw.<br /><br />The canopy - it's a great UPF protected canopy made of breathable fabric, again quality materials. but it CLICKS loudly into place once fully extended, and I can see this startling a baby. Also, as many others have mentioned, the clearance for your hands is barely there while trying to carry. Honestly, I bought the car seat anyway knowing this and having seen it in many videos. I am not bothered by it as much because the car seat is so light and easy to handle that I don't need to do too much &#34;manhandling.&#34; I'm sure my husband might disagree with his bigger hands, but we will see.<br /><br />I'm happy I went with it, and look forward to lots of road trips!

1,4,0,0,0,,"UPDATED NOV 2008<br />I have owned this car seat since March and have it installed with Latch long method since my daughter is still under 40 lbs (see manual) with the incline bar in place in the back of the seat. It is installed in a 2003 Honda Odyssey in the bucket seat behind the driver's seat.<br /><br />I came home from shopping today to find my daughter in the seat and the end of one of the shoulder straps in her lap!  Broken.  I removed the seat from my car and upon turning it over found that the strap had completely frayed in the spot where it comes to end in the black metal clip underneath the seat. The elastic piece that holds the seat cover onto the seat has snapped in several places also.  The other shoulder strap is about 50% frayed in its black metal clip. The seat elastic on that side looks undamaged.<br /><br />I called Britax and was told that there is no recall on any of the Regents. They are sending me replacement straps and buckles free of charge.  They were nice but did not seem concerned.<br /><br />My daughter is only 38 pounds, so we have a long way to go to the 80 pound limit.  I am of course disappointed and alarmed.<br /><br />And now for the if's:<br />If the straps frayed once, what are the chances that the new ones will do the same? When I originally installed the seat I took it to the police station and they confirmed that the seat was installed properly.  However, in looking at the seat in my living room, I am wondering if the seat itself was reclined too far, thus putting all of the weight of the seat onto the back where the straps are and not on the seat bottom and causing the damage. If that is the case I feel like there is a design flaw, considering that I did have the incline bar installed.<br /><br />I am just left wondering, what happened?! I feel like I wasted $200, and am trying to decide whether to purchase something else altogether or try installing this seat differently when I receive the replacement parts...  I was really hoping that this seat would be the one that would last until we didn't need any type of seat anymore, as I prefer the 5 point harness over the shoulder/lap belt on a regular booster.  If you own this seat, PLEASE check it to make sure your straps are still intact.<br /><br />Original Review<br />We purchased this seat for our three year old and gave the Roundabout to her infant brother. The seat is very roomy, and has lots of positions to adjust the straps. The straps have extra cushions on them and they don't tangle. The seat is huge, but since it's in a minivan in a single bucket seat it fits pretty well. Because the seat is so large I do worry that as my daughter's legs get longer she's going to be somewhat crunched; she sits behind the driver's seat, and I can only move my seat so far forward to give her room. The seat was easy to install with LATCH.<br /><br />The reason I am only giving the seat four stars is because even though the five point harness can be used up to 80 lbs, the seat is only supposed to be installed with LATCH up to 50 lbs. This is per the manual that comes with the seat. After that the seat is supposed to be installed with a regular seatbelt. The whole reason I wanted this seat is because it went up to 80 with the 5 point harness, and I thought that was using LATCH the whole time; I would have liked to know that it only went up to 50 with LATCH before I bought it. I just wonder how much safer it is having a seat with the five point harness when it's only installed with the seatbelt.",673,Yes,"Seat Type: Forward Facing

First off Albee Baby has very fast shipping!<br /><br />I have a two year old son and he needed a few more car seats because I was tired of installing my Britax marathon in different cars every few days. I bought two gracos so my husband and I each have one in our cars and that way the marathon can stay in grandma's car because it so easy to buckle him properly for her hands.<br /><br />I like everything about these seats! They installed with latch super easy and the install is so tight, it's as if it was built into my cars.<br /><br />I love the fit. My son fits so comfortable in these seats and with the recline feature, plus the natural recline of my back seats it makes naps comfortable for him.<br /><br />Right now he is on the lowest setting and middle crotch buckle slot. I like that there are 3 crotch slots it will make extended harnessing longer easier as he grows.<br /><br />I also love the 10 year expiration(from the date of manufacture). That truly means this seat will last him until he no longer needs a seat, so now I Will just have to replace the britax marathon when he outgrows it.<br /><br />I do love the no rethread harness feature as well, it makes it so much easier not having to take the seat out(which is what I love about my britax.<br /><br />I don't know what some reviews are talking about when they say they can't get the straps tight enough and that it's hard to adjust the straps. On both of our seats it's super easy. Actually it easier to adjust these straps then on my britax.<br /><br />My son loves his new seats!<br /><br />I would recommend these and I love our new seats!

I’ve always used chicco car seats with my kids, but after researching this company and having the opportunity to try this car seat out for free I jumped at the chance.<br /><br />I love that Diono is a US based company, and one that works prioritizes safety. Like I’ve said I’ve always used chicco, and while I’ve had no complaints about their car seats I do feel like Diono is a step up, though the prices are fairly comparable.<br /><br />First impressions of the Radian 3RXT….. WOW! It was packaged nicely. And the instruction booklet has a handy little pocket on the side for storage! I know that doesn’t seem like a big deal, but when you’re transitioning the car seat with your growing child and you can’t remember what’s what because you can’t find the booklet, this will be so nice.<br /><br />Loved the bright red color. The fabric is very nice, quality stitching. Chest straps are cushioned well and have sort of an anti-slip texture on the back side. That comes in super handy for us parents with those kids that love to adjust their own straps when they shouldn’t!<br /><br />It folds for travel, although you might rethink that because this thing is BEAST! It is heavy! I’ve lugged caresses through the airport before, but I’m not sure I’d recommend this one for travel.<br /><br />It also has a nice memory foam cushion in the seat.<br /><br />Now as far as using the seat, I don’t have much input on the infant or reverse stages. I used it for a few months in the forward facing five point harness stage. And currently using the high back booster. I felt comfortable with my daughter’s safety in both stages. It was just as easy to install as our chicco.<br /><br />Initially I was not a fan of the seat belt placement of the chest strap. On our other booster there is a plastic holder that you slide the belt into and with the Diono you just slide it beside the headrest. It just seemed a little awkward for placement, but it’s worked fine and I used to it now.<br /><br />I love the slim design. I always have two car seats in my vehicle and it can be difficult squeezing between them, when you need that third seat. I wish my other car seat was like this one! And even though it’s slimmer, my little still had plenty of seat room.<br /><br />It took my a second to figure out the cup holder! Just shove it in there and turn! Again another thing that initially threw me, but now it makes so much more sense!<br /><br />And with the 120 lb weight maximum, I don’t anticipate ever having to buy another car seat!<br /><br />Overall, I’m really impressed.

2,4,0,0,5,,"I have too many carseats due to people visiting and travelling.  Our main seats used to be Britax Marathon, but they're so heavy and my chest protector thingy broke on one.  I had a different Safety 1st for travelling and really liked it, so I got this one for my car while my daughter's dad was borrowing my Marathon (rear facing, so the plastic protector wasn't needed).<br /><br />I really like this seat.  The base is high enough that my daughter (now forward facing) can see out the windows from the center seat.  It was a little more difficult to install- took my boyfriend kneeling on it to tighten it properly, but it's solid now.  It's easy to adjust the back so the straps can grow with her, as those grey plastic twist things control the height.  The removable cup holder is a godsend.<br /><br />A BIG issue that pops up occasionally is that the straps can sometimes get stuck when trying to tighten.  As in, they just don't tighten anymore and it's still loose on my daughter.  It seems to happen more when the tightening strap is pulled up (which is how we tighten our other Safety 1st), but it's also just hard to tighten properly in general.  I'm glad I didn't have this seat when my daughter was really small, as I can't imagine struggling to get it tight enough.  In all though, I do like this seat, but eventually I'll get around to replacing it with the Britax (once I remember to call in for replacement parts).

I absolutely love this carseat and would have rated this a 5 star but after using it for 1.5 years it began to make this horrible rattle sound when driving.

I am very disappointed in the customer service. You try sitting listening to a non stop rattle. After spending over $300 on a carseat I expect it to not be annoying. My husband duct taped the entire inside of the carseat to help me so I don't get a headache every time we drive but it didn't make a difference. I am very sad that Chicco doesn't back up there product and basically says to live with it. I used to swear by Chicco.

This seat was hard as a rock and just seemed so uncomfortable. The crotch strap was much shorter than expected and very close and tight, my son did not fit in it comfortably. Honestly, it seemed cheaply made.<br /><br />Honestly, if parents are trying to go cheap, I would just buy a $40 Cosco brand booster with the 5pt harness from Walmart.

For $60 more, you will have a safet, more comfortable and well made seat that actually FITS.<br /><br />If you actually care about how comfortable your child will be on a car ride, don't buy this seat.

But after assembling it and using it for a few weeks, it's not what I expected. I will start with what I disliked. Upon assembling it, I had a hard time connecting the back piece. It does use extra force, but a bit more then I expected. The cloth cover is great quality, but I was not happy with how it was connected to the seat. The directions explained there were 2 top hooks to connect to, and there was not on my seat. I looked everywhere and had my husband check to see if I was missing something and there were no hooks. There was a little nub but the straps wouldn't stay on. I did find 2 hooks tucked in another spot but had to really stretch the cloth and it almost tore. So I made it work, but it's not correct. I could also use a tool to pull the strap through the other side of the car seat to try and keep it on, but it was so difficult and not an easy hook like every other one. It's almost as if the hooks were placed incorrectly on my seat. The seat is also kinda flimsy. When my son leaned over to fasten his seat belt it easily would tip to the side. So it did not seem sturdy on the leather seat. My favorite feature was how the seatbelt ran through the back of the booster seat. The seatbelt stayed in place and didn't come out. Which was really nice! It was easy for my 5 year old to reach the seatbelt and buckle it himself. The seatbelt is pretty tight in there so you have to pull a little harder to buckle up. The head rest was also very easy to adjust which was nice. Over all, the Evenflo Go Time LX booster is a great price point, but I'd rather pay more money to get something that was more sturdy and an easier set up.

So I rushed to Babies R Us to get a new one to find that they were sold out of all but the Advocate, so I bought it.<br />A couple of cons that annoy me regularly:<br /><br />1. The release for the straps is very tight. It almost seems like it hasn't released and you have to tug at it. Not as smooth and easy as the Boulevard.<br />2. The cost.<br />3. The size. It's huge! This doesn't matter much in my minivan, but we travel a lot and it would be terrible on the plane. It's also heavy.<br /><br />So if you're wondering why I bought another, here's why:<br /><br />1. They redesigned the Boulevard and basically it's now the Pavillion. One of the things they eliminated on the new model was the click safe. It's silly, but I love that feature.<br />2. Amazon had an awesome sale.<br />3. I wash the covers when needed and I did not want to have 3 different seats to buy covers for. I couldn't return the seat we'd needed on the trip for the Pavillion and I needed a seat for my second son in my husband's car, so when this went on sale, I bought it.<br /><br />In the end I still wish the store we ran to had the Pavillion, but oh well.",240,Yes,"Seat Type: Boulevard, Advocate, Pavillion

So far we've only used the rear-facing with harness seat for our infant. I really like that there's a lot of cushioning and support with the infant insert. It helps keep their head for bobbling all around and provides surrounding protection from all sides. I think this is a crucial feature because a baby's head and neck are so fragile and must be fully supported at all times. The harness is easy to tighten/loosen and holds them firmly in place while driving. It also comes with padding on the arm rests, which believe or not, a lot of car seats don't have. The dual cup holders are nice for storing drinks and snacks while driving. My other favorite feature is how easy the cover is to remove and throw in the washing machine after any messes. Then you can easily snap it right back in before you're next trip out. I haven't come across any issues with this car seat whatsoever as of yet, but I haven't had the opportunity to use the older child configurations.

0,7,0,0,2,,"I’m going to try my best to explain this...but here is my review on the Safety 1st Jive Convertible car seat.<br /><br />I purchased this car seat to put in my moms truck as a rear facing car seat until Posey is flipped front facing. I installed it in my car to begin with so I could make sure it was set up properly and ready to go before we made our trip to North Dakota. I noticed there was a slight issue when I put it in my car but figured it was because I did it quick. So I took it to my moms and installed it in her truck for the trip. Thought all was good and we started our journey. We stopped to get gas the first time and noticed Posey was leaning further back and the level line was no longer level to the ground. Figured I did it wrong again and just reinstalled the seat and continued going. Stopped for gas again and the seat was leaning backwards again. So again I adjusted it and went about our way. When we made it to our destination I made a comment to my mom that the seat just wasn’t securing the right way. Pulled the book out and made sure I did everything as it states and I had. So we just went about our trip. Then we moved the kids seats from my moms truck to my sisters truck and I could not for the life of me get it to sit properly rear faced. So I turned her front facing against my own judgement because it was secure and felt safer then putting her in it rear facing. I felt better about it if she sat front facing then rear at this point because clearly something was off with the seat. We went to leave and head back to California and I installed it in my moms truck again and it just wouldn’t secure right. So I rolled up a blanket and put it underneath it hoping that would help. And it didn’t... so we put her front facing again which in turn caused her to get carsick and vomit all over. So I rolled those blankets back up and flipped her back around and drove home. I wrote the company an email about my concerns and hadn’t heard back. But it just wasn’t sitting well with me. So I called them today and they pulled my email up and spent 30 minutes FaceTiming me to ensure that I was installing the seat correctly. Which I was. They called another employee in to watch me install and tighten the seat into the car. I showed them how easily it pushes backwards and how she would wind up laying on her back just about in the car. They told me the seat isn’t compatible with my car. I told them I have installed this specific seat in not one, but three different vehicles and it does it in all three. They said that it must not be compatible with any of them. I looked on their website to find a compatible car seat list and couldn’t find one. Also read reviews on amazon and their website stating the same issue I’m having. They ended up issuing me a refund and having me destroy this seat and will ‘look into’ others to see if they are having the same issue. I’m not sure how I feel about that but I hope this post sways some people on purchasing this and saves a babies life. Because even the lady on the phone from the company said the seat should not push backwards so far that the baby is laying on their back. Your child should not be able to push their feet on the back seat and move the car seat backwards. Ever. And that was the point I was trying to prove to them. I’m not sure if they even believe me.

It took me a minute to read the directions to make the proper adjustments and depending on how you secure it (seatbelt or latch/front facing or rear facing) it can be a challenge to secure.  Once it IS secure, the seat is very nice to use.  What I like most is the weight limit and it will be the last car seat that I will have to purchase because it is convertible.  On the other hand, it initially was a pain to clean and I had to watch a You Tube video on how to dismantle it and clean it best.  Once I watched and did it, I had no problems repeating the process.  This seat is as heavy as any other convertible seat, there's no advantage in that regard, but my daughter seems to really like the attached cup holders and side pockets for her toys.<br /><br />The only other thing, is that I found the buckle a little hard to disengage.

Once your child is too large for the smallest setting on the 5 point harness, follow the instructions to REMOVE THE BODY SUPPORT.

2,5,0,0,5,,"So I’d like to give this car seat a fair review. We’ve purchased two of them and there are some amazing pros but also some horrible cons that make me regret ever buying these very expensive car seats, that I am now stuck with FOREVER.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Super easy to install<br />2.  Very easy to adjust as child grows<br /><br />Cons<br />1.  IMPOSSIBLE to actually clean when you have a messy child.<br /><br />Let me explain. My three year old son has had this seat for a year and a half. Trying to take the car seat pad off is an adventure in and of itself. You need a YouTube video just to figure it out. But that’s not even the worst part.<br /><br />There’s no way to clean up a big mess. It seeps down into the actual car seat which you can’t disassemble to clean or fix. My son peed on his by accident. He was asleep and woke himself up by peeing. I cleaned the pad and even sprayed down the seat, because it had pee all down in it. Thank goodness I don’t keep my manual where they suggest or it would have had urine on it as well. The manufacturer suggests that you spot clean or just wash the pad.  But that does nothing if the mess is all the way down into the seat.  They even say you shouldn’t spray down the seat, but I can’t exactly leave pee sloshing around in it now can I.<br />So spray it I did, which then water gets in it. Oh the predicament. But water is better than pee right.<br /><br />Scenario two. My youngest daughter puked on hers. No big deal it’s mostly on the pad and that’s washable. You know what’s not washable, the super high tech straps. First you can’t get them off the seat. So you have to bring the whole seat to the bath, use a bowl of water etc to clean those bad boys. Your supposed to just spot clean those. But that doesn’t really take the puke smell out. So you can incorrectly wash it with some type of chemical and worry that you’ve destroyed the strap or you can live with puke smell. Neither are a good option in my opinion.<br /><br />Now I’ve only had to clean these a few times but each time has made me want to pull my hair out.<br /><br />So mommas save yourself the headache and buy a different seat. Because I don’t know to many kids who aren’t messy and you don’t want to keep their mess FOREVER.<br /><br />Graco please redesign these seats with children in mind. They spill, pee, puke etc all over their seats sometimes multiple times in a week. Make it easy for the mom to clean it up, being a mom is hard enough already without car seats that cause more trouble than they are worth.",490,Yes,"Installation Type: Super easy to install

Originally, I purchaed three of the Graco TurboBooster Backless Booster Car Seat, Galaxy.  However, this product does not come standard with the latch system.  What troubles me is the fact that I had to buy the Graco Affix Highback Booster Seat with Latch System for approx. $85 versus the backless booster seat for approx. $28.  Now granted I realize the highback booster includes the back but still it forced me to have to buy the entire system just to get the booster seat with the latch system which looks to be as the SAME booster seat for the TurboBooster backless Booster car seat however just less the latches.

I'm not a wealthy individual however for those less fortunate on finances it really puts consumers in a troubling spot.

2,4,0,0,1,,"This is the only car seat new parents are going to need.  It's designed to work from newborn all the way to 100 lbs, and while I initially dismissed the claim as hyperbolic sales talk...it's actually accurate.  I tried this seat in those age ranges and it worked very well for all of them.<br /><br />This seat also has a lot of design innovations, so many that, yes, it kind of makes me want to have another child.  Certainly though, it makes the old fogey parent in me kind of grumble about how easy parents these days have it.  Really.  But here, let's start at the beginning.<br /><br />This is a very sturdy, very overbuilt car seat.  It's designed to nestle your child in layers of protection, and unlike car seats from even ten years ago, a lot of attention is paid to child comfort as well.  Padding is generous and firm enough to last the 6-7 years you'll be using it.  Covers are easily removed and machine washable.  The frame is pretty beefy and has staying power.  Hence, when Safety 1st says this will be the only seat you need, they really did build it with that claim in mind.<br /><br />Innovations abound.  For example, on older car seats when your child grows you need to rethread the safety harness through the appropriate slots on the back of the seat.  Not so with this.  No, there are two thumb clamps you squeeze and then you can unlock the back of the seat and move it up or down.  That's right, no rethreading needed, and the adjustment is fine enough to give your chlld a more or less custom fit.  More importantly, you DON'T need to remove the car seat from the car to make this adjustment.  Adjusting harness tension is easy, with the adjustment strap and clamp in the front of the car seat.<br /><br />Another innovation are harness clips on either side of the seat, in which you can place the shoulder harness straps and make getting your child in and out of the car seat that much easier.  Having something like that (as opposed to fishing behind your kid for the shoulder straps after you put him in the seat) is a serious convenience.<br /><br />Two built-in cupholders are included, rubber lined and sized just right for a sippy cup.<br /><br />Instructions are clear for when it's time to convert this into a booster seat.  The harness and buckle all stow away, and there's a clear channel (marked with a helpful red patch) through which the seatbelt is threaded.  It works, and works well.  Moreover, it's still comfortable, thanks to all that padding. My five year old didn't want to get out of it.<br /><br />So in sum, this is an outstanding car seat, one that I think is best in class, and one that pays attention to the future of your family.  I never liked having to pay money every couple of years for a new car seat, so seeing a product like this that makes such an outlay unnecessary is fantastic.

I liked that this seat had that option and it seems meshy enough that it *might* work.<br /><br />The biggest reason we chose this one is the strap to tighten it pulls so smoothly and effortlessly.  We tried it in the store and were blown away how much easier it was. I got it 3 months ago and I’m loving everything about it.  The Graco infant seat was annoying to adjust and I felt I had to pull very hard to get it right enough for my child’s safety, but this is so smooth and easy to pull.

No standing on the seat and tugging a strap to tighten it (y’all know you’ve done it!) or breaking your hands trying to undo the latch hooks buried in the abyss of your seat.  You just stretch the seatbelt across and close the seat down to clamp it in. I don’t know how it works but it gets a tight fit every single time with zero wiggle.

Obviously, I can't try the seat in every vehicle, but in the two I did try, the seat installed tight with very little effort.  The rear facing recline was perfect without any rolled towels or pool noodles as well.<br />- The adjuster pulled very smooth and I didn't have any issues with the harness wanting to fold over in the buckle.<br />- The instructions were very clear.<br />- Nice, deep sides and good side impact protection.

It can be difficult to get set up if you're constantly moving it because of the mechanism that is used to pull the shoulder belt down to a child's height.

Since the ProSport was recently recalled, I was informed that because of the recall we could no longer use the latch in booster mode. So I wanted to replace it with a safe booster seat that latched to the vehicle for safety and convenience. Who wants a 30 lb projectile in their car, not me!! I considered the Clek Oobr and Cybex Solution Q-Fix. The Oobr apparently has a short seat pan and is uncomfortable for a lot of kids, especially tall kids like my daughter. The Cybex looks like a great booster. However I was recommended this booster by a CPST and at more than half the price of the other boosters it was a great value. It also becomes a backless booster which the Cybex doesn't do. It is also rated a Best Bet booster by the IIHS. The other great features that only Britax has is the safeguard which keeps the lap belt in the proper position and the safe cell in the base which reduces the forward movement in your child in a collision. At first when I looked at the booster online I had 2 main concerns. Was it upright and flimsy? I can now say no to both of those concerns. This seat is so sturdy and well made. Very solid and substantial. The fabric is very nice looking and great quality, very thick. My daughter loves the pink and it looks great in our van. The bottom part of the booster where the child sits is very well padded and has a thick cushion. The booster back hinges slightly which allows you to get a great angle in your car. I have seen other reviewers think this is a defect but it is designed like that so you can get a great angle for different cars. This seat fits perfect in my Honda Odyssey 2nd row captain's chair. It is so easy to latch in, it takes about 1 minute. My daughter has a perfect seatbelt fit in this booster. The headrest is very easy and smooth to move up and down. I was very sad to have to move her out of a 5 point harness but seeing her so well secured and comfortable in this booster has put my mind at ease. I have come to love the quality and safety of Britax! My youngest is in a Britax Chaperone and my 3 year old is getting the Frontier 90 to replace his recalled ProSport. Britax has great customer service as well. My ONLY complaint with the seat so far is that it is made in China, I wish Britax would produce ALL of their seats in the USA.

I think this chair is best for people who own cars and are okay with leaving it semi-permanently inside a car. For those who live in cities, the best aspect of this car is that you can easily put this into a cab or Uber. The killer design aspect is the ability to raise the seat, thread the seat belt under the seat and click the chair back into place. There is no need to lift up the entire seat cloth as with others.

I love the 2 built in cup holders! Yes, the seat may be wider because of it, but I love having a spot for my toddlers sippy cup and another cup holder for snacks/binkies/toys. Cup holders will fit most types of sippy cups and bottles(see photo).<br />3.

0,7,0,2,3,-1-1,"I installed rear facing using the seatbelt option in the middle of my backseat (not using LATCH) and it is a very difficult process.  You are required to remove the seat cover to run the car's seatbelt underneath where it also has 2 clips to clamp down on the seatbelt.  You have to push down on the seat and pull the belt as tight as possible and then force down these clips.  Once installed you of course would need to put the cover back however it has to clip in multiple places on the underside of the front of the seat...which is now pressed very firmly against the back of your car!  The tighter you install the seat the harder it will be to replace the seat cover.<br /><br />Once installed usage was horrible.  There are 2 sets of straps one of which is only a few inches long and stationary near the top of the large main straps.  This means most of the ways that you would instinctively grab the straps to pull and loosen them to remove your child will not loosen them but instead simply pull on these weird smaller straps and stop.  You essentially have to leave the chest clip connected and pull on it specifically to get the main straps to loosen.<br /><br />Then there are these weird rigid rubber things on the front.  They are too large get in the way.  I think they pinched my baby at least once and made her cry and simply made it difficult to loosen or tighten the straps (second part of the design which inhibited its function).  If I had kept this seat I most definitely would have removed these weird giant pieces of hard rubber.<br /><br />The last straw for me was that I noticed when I finally could tighten the straps they did not apply even pressure.  I would get them tight but while on her left side it was extremely snug her right side was still loose, enough to easily get at least a finger under.  I checked the straps throughout and never noticed anything out of position or twisted.  It seemed to be a flaw in the design where things connected in the back of the seat using a metal bracket which didn't seem to apply pressure evenly.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this seat is that it fit easily in my backseat which is small enough to have been a challenge and certainly some seats, like our Recaro, would not fit properly.  Not much of a plus though because I don't think this seat is safe to use.",440,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear Facing

1,5,1,2,3,,"I bought this to replace my kid's car seat because despite being so petite, she is old enough now that i thought it would be a little strange(and even a little embarrassing) to keep her in a car seat.  I was also hoping that it would be easier for her to buckle herself in compares to the multi point car seat straps. We were using a safety first air headrest car seat that has a weight rating up to 60 lbs and my daughter is only 36 lbs.<br /><br />I ordered this because i like the idea of the head guard in the event of a side impact collision and the seatbelt over the shoulder guides built in to help keep the seat belt from slipping into a bad/ dangerous position.<br /><br />Upon receiving this booster a few things jumped out at me immediately.<br /> first i noticed how lightweight this booster is.  Lightweight is good, but i was put off by it because the second thing i notice was how flimsy the back of this seat seemed to me.  The construction and design seems like it would break pretty easy if mishandled outside the vehicle.<br />I notice some people didn't like the amount of padding on the seat, but it doesnt seem to be any less padded than the carseats we've owned.<br /><br />A sure-fire plus for me is the narrow width of the seat.  With two safety first car seats int he back of my car, we were barely able to fit 5th passengers in our car between them.  Replacing one of the car-seats with this booster should make that last passenger a lot more comfortable as now there is about 4 or 5 extra inches for them to sit.<br /><br />Most importantly for me though, i am unhappy how my daughter is no longer able to buckle herself.  This is partially a short coming of my vehicle as the buckles are inset into the seat instead of the flopping out kind.  it makes it very difficult (impossible in our situation) for a relatively young kid in a booster to reach under and around to the buckle.  I have to get out of the car buckle my daughter in now when i pick her up in  a busy line of parents getting their kids., which makes all the other parent s behind me in line, have to wait on me.  With a car seat, my daughter had no problem buckling her harness, so now it feels like we have taken a step back in safety and convenience.<br /><br />I think i am going to look into a seat belt extender to held with the buckle situation, and see if that helps.",453,Yes,"Seat Type: booster

0,3,0,0,1,,"We received 3 of these, so I can say with certainty that the problems listed below were not unique to one bad 'lemon'.<br /><br />While this is lightweight, as advertised, there were several issues.<br /><br />1.) The headrest is secured by a small piece of Velcro which is insufficient to the job.<br />2.) The slot for inserting the seat belt for rear-facing installation is too small to fit your hand through, oddly shaped, and has sharp plastic edges which scrape your hand. In order to install the seat belt, the fabric cover of the car seat needs to be un-clipped, and then you can access the slot from both sides of the hold and feed the belt through.<br />3.) The button/lever for releasing tension on the straps located between their feet is located in a very small hole cut out of the plastic frame. When you pull your thumb or finger out of the hole, it catches on the plastic edge and cuts your thumb. I had a rather gruesome experience with this, and had a friend and a daycare professional test it and they both were shocked at how sharp the plastic edge was and how easily it caught their thumb.<br />4.) My child who is 7mo old, and average weight/height for her age, does not look comfortable in the seat.

The actual seat itself, the plastic- is not hard like our other Graco. It is flexible and I can bend, push, pull it. For reinforcement, there are two thin one inch bars. Our other seats have much larger and stronger reinforcement bars. I picture in my head, a large vehicle hitting my baby girl side of the car and this seat does not feel safe to me. We are returning and purchasing the Britax One4Life. My heart says no to this seat. My bank was happy but I don’t feel like this would protect my girl in my sedan. This would be better for an suv, van, truck. But overall please check the plastic and make sure you’re okay with it before you use it for you child. It is a great seat because it has a circular cup holder, it only has one but some have square cup holders! So that’s nice. We purchased because the seat cover removes easy and our daughter gets sick in the car easy but I will invest in a steam cleaner just for her Britax. It does not have a removable cover at all, only the headrest from what I read so that is a downside. The cost with the accessories is $500.

Its much more comfortable too. Lots of removable padding. My daughter is much happier sitting in this seat than the Chicco we had. The only negative features are lack of leg room and the cover doesn't come off easily for washing. The leg room is an issue when facing backward but this is probably an issue for most convertibles. This is a large seat. It barely fits in my wife's 4 door BMW 3series and leaves no room for front seat passengers. If you have anything smaller, you better do a test install before buying.<br />While I respect the fact that the cover is well secured, the car seat has to be uninstalled in order to remove the cover due to cleaning. This is not an easy to install car seat. Most of the difficulty directly relates to safety features built into the carseat,so that's not really a drawback.

The description says it is suitable for infants from 5lb plus, we tried our daughter at 16lb and it just isn't comfortable for young ones. The 3 level recline does not go far enough back and the whole child is still almost vertical which means if they can sleep the head slumps forward which is dangerous.

0,4,0,1,0,,"This is the coolest car seat we have ever owned, and we have owned a lot.  The only thing this doesn’t have is tech running through it.  The instruction booklet is a must and thankfully, this car seat does have a tray located at the base to store the booklet! For when you need to make adjustments, remove the seat, etc.  Also, this isn’t just for you, this is great for the friend, other parent, grandparent etc. that is helping you and may have no idea how this seat works.<br /><br />I am sure some people are questioning my sanity about this trivial thing; but until you are sitting in a parking lot crying because you can’t figure out how to release the car seat from a locking base you will never understand my excitement of this feature.  (Yes, that is a true story. )<br /><br />The seat cover can be completely removed to wash.  I have not had to remove my cover to wash it I have only used wash rags/ wipes to clean up spills.  The side panels feel almost like canvas but with a coating on them.  While the inside portion (where child sits) of the car seat is covered in a non-abrasive material that is a squishy (feel like memory foam) padding.<br /><br />There are two removable head pillows, and a lumbar support / booster.  I really wish my vehicle had this little thing.  The belts expand with a simple push of the button located in the front of the seat, and then gently pull the harness straps.  If you loosen too much pull the sing strap at the base to tighten.  You can do this one handed.<br /><br />There is a recline feature on the seat.  To engage it once you pull a ‘trigger leaver’ at the bottom of the car seat, it is located in the front (where ankles would sit when taller) just pull forward and seat reclines.  Again, this can be done one handed.<br /><br />The car seat clamps to the vehicle metal U rings located in the back seat area, in addition it uses the seat belt to keep the seat stable & secure.  When you first take the seat out of the box the clamps are already attached but tucked up under the outer sides for storage.  At first, I thought these clamps were broken because when you press the release (red) button on them nothing happens; however when hooking them on you hold them like a Taser and push them onto the metal bars of the U rings until you hear them click.  These will not disconnect unless you hold the red button, just like a seat belt, but you have to pull away from the ring while the button is engaged.<br /><br />The cup holders lock into place, they are somewhat small but do hold a bottle securely unlike other holders. Larger sippy cups may not fit, I recommend checking yours first.  You can remove them, to make the holder area bigger and for cleaning.  You can run them through a dishwasher.<br /><br />Overall this car seat looks and feels like it should be in a space shuttle, it’s very sturdy and not excessively heavy.  It isn’t the removable kind you can use in a stroller but if you are looking to buy 1 seat that will grow with your child I believe this is it.

The seat is very heavy, but that is a good thing in my opinion. I feel like it is sturdy and safe. I installed it in my car yesterday. It took less than 5 minutes to properly install the seat. The latch system on this seat is super easy to tighten. In the past, I have sat in and kneeled in seats while pulling with all my might to get them tight enough. With this seat, all I had to do was pull each latch strap, and it was in super tight! I think that is my favorite feature so far. I also loved that it has 9 recline options. My car has pretty deep bucket seats in the back, and I didn't want to have to roll up a towel or something to get the proper recline. I didn't have any problems finding the correct angle. The bubble level feature is great! The only complaint I have is that the straps seem a little stiff, and it is a little tough to get them as tight as I like once the baby is in the seat.

Bought from Target.<br /><br />Likes:<br />1.  Cushioning/styling is very nice.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />1. The belts do not slide very well through the slide points.  This includes the cinch to take slack out of/put slack in the harness and ESPECIALLY the latch system whether tightening or loosening.  These should work with minimal resistance, not be near impossible to pull (it’s like the release button didn’t work at all).<br />2. The way the seat is balanced in the rear facing direction.  The latch system Doesn’t seem to be properly positioned, which causes the seat to not be stable enough to stay in one place.  Even with both the latch system and the shoulder belt threaded through there, the bottom rear of the seat (car forward) is rounded and will fall with weight added to the seat back.  If you couple this with number one, 2 very seemingly unsafe things will happen (look at the picture): the seat will lay down, as the bottom of the seat starts to ride up the car seat back, and the seat will sway from side to side.  I tried sitting all 260 lbs of me onto the car seat to get it to go down as far as possible, then tried securing the latch belt as best I could and the thing lasted 2 days in this position and by the third day started to fall/slide.<br />3. The seat is difficult to adjust.  You have to pull out the seat bottom (booster) completely and make your adjustments, then thread both the latch system AND harness back into the seat bottom, which, for me, a 21 year technician took three hands to do well.  A few times I’d get 3/4 belts seated properly, only to have the booster not seat properly back into the seat back, or one got caught in a pinch point and I had to do the thing all over again.<br />4. The price for what it is.  Look, it’s a lot of molded plastic and well padded cushions and at first glance it looks like it should be worth what they’re asking, but when you take into account all the problems I had with it, it didn’t do near as well as the $219 Graco I exchanged it for.  Night and day difference.  Granted, the Graco doesn’t “look” as nice as this one, but the user friendliness of the evenflo is atrocious.<br /><br />With all the other positive reviews I wonder if  I got a bad apple.  I wonder if the system that tightened up the belts needed some lubrication or something, but the design flaws are there molded right into the plastic.  I’m happy I got my money back and that the Graco was so much better.  I’m not being paid by any company, I just hope some guy doesn’t make the same mistake I did.

Make sure you twist down and hear the click.<br /><br />Dimensions:  this seat has a lower profile that the Graco contender, which is one of the reasons I chose this seat.

She looks very comfortable in the seat and has plenty of room. I'm confident she will be able to use the seat for a good while. She is on the small side, about 37 inches tall and only 33 pounds. Aside from all the safety features, my favorite part is the belly buckle is always stuck forward, no more sitting on it.<br />I previously installed her old seat with the seatbelt as the Diplomat (like the Roundabout but with the side wings) didn't have the independent latch hooks for each side of the seat, I wasn't able to get it as tight with latch. This seat was super easy to install with latch. I fiddled with the seatbelt lock off and that looked relatively simple too, you just have to slip your fingers between the front of the seat cover. The cover is able to be taken off without taking the seat out of the car and taking all the straps off- that may make it easier to install with the seatbelt so you can see what you're doing.<br />I also love how long the seats last before expiring, and they hold up very well, her old seat will be passed down to our second child, due in June.

So we had to install it, check the bubble, loosen the latch, change the tilt, and reinstall it which was pretty inconvenient.<br /><br />The strap to tighten/loosen the 5pt harness is comically short.

My 30-month, 30-pound son is very comfy, and it's super easy to adjust around his clothing, etc.  NOTE: I don't recommend putting it together in a parking lot at 11PM in winter, as it takes some time to assemble and is hard to do with cold fingers :)<br /><br />UPDATE 9/24/10: I have to knock this down a star now that my kid has grown some more.  We had to remove him from the 5-point harness just before his 5th birthday, even though he's only about 44lbs.  The crotch strap on this is TOO CLOSE to the back of the seat.  So when we buckle him in 5-point, it smushes his 'stuff' and makes him uncomfortable for the whole ride. It became so much of an issue that we had to discontinue use of the harness and go to the belt.  The whole reason I got this was for the high-weight limit on the 5-pt.  In addition, it's VERY hard to clean.  Easy enough to get the pads off and wash, etc, but when you disassemble it there are a ton of little crevices that are filled with nasty stuff (cracker crumbs, raisins, you name it) that is SO hard to get out!

I had the Britax B-Safe, and it was a snug fit for any passengers, and any front seat passenger could only recline the seat so far. Rather than buying a car to fit a seat, I figured there will be more options for the convertible car seats. Wrong. I tried every. single. one. at Babies R Us, to zero avail. I was trying to stick within a less than $200 budget so as much as I drooled over the NextFit it was too pricey ($299.99 at BRU).<br />When I did the test fit, it was considerably comfortable. It is much narrower in the base compared to other convertible car seats. It has multiple recline positions so if you're fitting it in a small car rear-facing, you can adjust it so your baby is safe but the front passengers can also be comfortable. Also, the overall height of the seat isn't ridiculous. For people not in an SUV- other convertible car seats literally were touching the roof of my car (ie all the Safety 1st brands!) They are so tall, I literally fit in them. This seat has a great adjustable head rest so by the time my child is tall enough to fully extend it  she will be forward facing and it will blend into the car's headrest but while smaller and rear facing it has a lower height profile.<br />I am only 5'3 and 100lbs, so getting straps tight has always been a downfall. With a husband deployed, I was honestly really nervous it would be a nightmare. Using LATCH, with the classic style strap to tighten plus the come-along style pulley, I was able to get it so tight it doesn't budge. I do recommend for those with leather, you put non-slip underneath! The straps can extend pretty long, so you wont have issues reaching your LATCH system (the Britax were just barely long enough even in my small car).<br />My daughter loves her new seat, she can see much more out the windows and its comfortable as far as I can tell.

1,3,0,0,0,Removable Seat Cushion,"We just purchased the boulevard g4 in Laguna, and this is the fourth Britax seat we own. Currently, we have another boulevard, a frontier and a parkway sgl. I love them, and I will never buy anything other than Britax. Since my oldest was born 10 years ago, I have gone through numerous graco, evenflo, safety 1st and Eddie Bauer seats, that were all junk compared to Britax. I thought all car seats were crappy, and I would just have to deal with them. That is, until I bought my first Britax 5 years ago. Since then, I have done my research on car seat safety, and I personally would never trust a cheap seat again.<br /><br />The boulevard has many great features. My favorite is the separate latch straps. I get a tight fit every time, and no need to untwist straps threaded through the seat. The easy adjustable headrest, removable cover without unthreading the harness, headwings, hugs, safe cell technology, steel reinforcement and tether that can be used rear facing- all wonderful! Not only great in safety, but also convenience.<br /><br />There is only one con I can come up with, on this pattern.  This would never, ever deter me from buying a Britax.<br />The material: It is so strange to me, how every pattern that Britax offers, varies in material. Some of them are all velvet/microfiber/plush, some are nylon, some are cotton etc. The Laguna blue color is a cotton material, so it doesn't seem as though it will clean up easily. It seems as though it will absorb any dirt or spills. Also, the black trim is a harder, scratchy material. So that is found on the headwings, infant pillow and strap covers. Now, it does not bother me enough to exchange it. I prefer color on the seats, and this is currently the only color offered. But, I own another boulevard, that is made of a plush material, and it just seems logical to offer a softer material on the head. It doesn't bother the baby at all though, so I don't think it's a huge deal. The only part that bothers me, is the shoulder strap covers. Since they are harder, they don't bend as easily and seem as snug as the other ones I have. The other two seats I own (boulevard and frontier) came in different materials and are a much better fit. And my other boulevard, frontier and parkway all are made of a different material in the middle. That material is easier to clean, and seems more repellant.<br /><br />So, if buying this again, I would still purchase the Laguna pattern. But if they offered Laguna in the same material as sterling or onyx? I would choose that option. I just don't know why Britax can't be consistent with their material. Oh well! Their seats more than make up for their material choice. I just wanted to point out the material on the Laguna, in case someone would want to know. I look to these reviews, when making a purchase that I can't see in person.",516,Yes,"Material: The Laguna blue color is a cotton material, so it doesn't seem as though it will clean up easily.

Once the baby insert comes out, it's extremely hard.  Infact, my son has a scar on his lower back, right on the spine from it constantly rubbing the spot where the latch is secured to the seat.  This is THROUGH all the cushioning.  My son has not sat in that car seat for a year and the spot is still visible on his back.  I did not realize what was causing this until I noticed my daughter had a scab in that exact spot.  Quick fix was to add a cloth diaper under the padding for more support.  And it's not just my seat, my nephew has the same spot from his seat as well.<br /><br />* The crotch strap is really close to the back.  This is a huge pain every time my 3 year old gets in the seat.  I have to dig under her to find it.  My son, who is skinny and short for his age, complained a lot about this strap so I eventually moved him to a new booster.  I was attempting to get more use out of this Nautilus by giving it to my daughter.  But the crotch strap is a paint for her as well.<br /><br />* It's not comfortable for long trips, there's no padding, too upright, might be okay for an older child who can sit more upright, but I would NOT recommend this for kids under four.<br /><br />* The release is sometimes difficult to open.  This can be a good thing if you have a houdini child, but when I'm hanging off the back of my driver's seat trying to release her seat belt so she can jump out for school it can be a real pain.<br /><br />On the plus side, I have washed the covers multiple times and it's held up great in the wash.

Its seems trivial but kids love sippy cups and it'd be nice to be able to use the cup holders for all the cups. Evenflo Symphony has the right idea for this. Also, one of the main reasons I switched my 4 month old over early is because the fabric on her infant carrier makes her so sweaty and uncomfortable that she hates being in there, so I was very disappointed to discover the giant warning label printed onto the back of the seat.

I can see now that, unfortunately, my oldest child was probably not secured safely in his seat.  I initially wanted a seat that reclined and this was one reason I went with the Triumph Advance.  However, once I read the manual, it seems that the recline position is only to be used with the rear-facing position and my child is too big for that.  The only drawback would be how large this seat is.  I have a larger vehicle so it is not an issue for me but I don't think this seat would fit in a small car.

We live in Atlanta where public transportation is almost never a realistic or safe option and thus everyone has to drive everywhere (especially on the weekends!).  So we knew we needed a quality car seat that could stand up to daily use.<br /><br />In our search, we looked at all of the major brands.  Nothing really impressed us until we found the Combi Connection.  The quality is really unmistakable--a solid handle, amazingly soft Eggshock foam (I don't think the new Connections have the Eggshock foam, which, if true, is a huge misjudgment on Combi's part), EPS foam, a quality pad cover made from expensive cloth, and a fantastic canopy.  The  Connection was also very easy to install using the LATCH system.  The Combi Connection stroller is also great--we use it everyday and have been very happy with it.  Some have criticized the Connection for not having notches to place the seat in the top half of a shopping cart.

Super comfy for my daughter and I feel that she is really well-protected.<br /><br />Quick tip regarding the click-tight, which I didn't feel was clear in the manual: don't over-tighten the seat belt or latch belt!<br /><br />If you are coming from any other type of seat, you're probably used to threading the belt and then pulling as hard as possible to get that sucker tight enough.  The way the ClickTight is designed to work, is the frame puts extra pressure on the belt as it closes, creating that tension for you.  The first time I tried to install, I saw right away why other reviewers have had issues with getting the seat to open back up again (even having to resort to pliers).  If the belt is too tight, you have to force the seat closed and then it is nearly impossible to open again.  What worked best for me was to just thread the belt through, removing any slack but not pulling it taut.  Then close the seat - it should close with one firm push, you shouldn't have to force it - if you're struggling, try actually LOOSENING the belt a little.  Once closed, THEN do the wiggle test and hopefully it should be rock solid.  I'm really satisfied with the system, and hope that tip helps other people like it better, too!",237,Yes,"Installation Type: ClickTight, seat belt, latch belt, threading the belt, pulling to tighten, belt too tight, loosen the belt, wiggle test"

I think you would be hard pressed to find a better car seat in this price category (especially if purchased with an Amazon Prime registry discount). I’ll just say that with our first we used the seat and base that came with our graco stroller travel system, and it was a pain to use. The base did not adjust, so we had to use a pool noodle underneath one side. The straps did not have the front pull to tighten and had to be manually adjusted in the back (for each time we were putting our son in and out of the seat!). The infant insert was useless and we used rolled up blankets around his head instead. The handle required both hands to adjust. We still used it until we upgraded to a convertible seat around 9-10 months, but it was annoying every time. This time around I was determined to get something nicer.<br /><br />This seat is the opposite of all those things and more! The handle requires one hand to raise and lower, the straps loosen and tighten with ease, the fabric itself is comfortable and supportive, and the base is adjustable to get the seat perfectly level. The canopy is also lovely and makes this seat look high end. It works with our old stroller too, which is a plus! I guess I didn’t know what we were missing out on before.

It's easy to installation. I only struggled getting the car seat into the upright back positio once I pulled it out of the box. The material is very breathable and spills on the material are wiped up quite easily. I wish Graco would consider an adaptation to the non-cupholder car seat arm. It would be much easier for someone to get their toddler out of the car seat if the arm would somehow swivel out or pull down. Since my son is so tall I often have to find a tricky way to maneuver him out of the car seat. Lifting him straight up and over the arm often results in his head brushing the roof of the car or very narrowly missing hitting the door frame.

The cup holder and armrests with built in pockets work well for the kids keeping everything within reach. The adjustable seat angle is just right in our Toyota Mini-Van to keep the kids upright yet still comfortable and, of course, safe. The adjustable seat back height allows it to be used for larger kids which was great when or oldest was ready to upgrade to a larger size; we are able to keep using the same seat!

I even took it to the fire station and they said that this was one of the most difficult installs (I have a Nissan Rogue) that they've ever done.  Additionally, the instructions for using the rear-facing install are ridiculous.  After about an hour, the installers decided it was safer to just use the seatbelt instead of the LATCH system.  Even in my parent's truck, which is completely flat, when I use the LATCH system, the belt invariably gets twisted and you its a bear to use the release latch.<br /><br />2)  UNCOMFORTABLE:  Even with towels and noodles underneath, this thing is at such a weird angle that when my daughter sleeps her head flops to a 90 degree angle from her body.  ALSO... the button part of the harness pushes into her belly whenever I tighten her into the seat.<br /><br />3)  HARNESS:  The harness catches about every other time that I put her in it.  I already contacted customer service for this once and got a replacement, but the new one does the same thing.  I end up having to finagle her out of the seat without releasing it and then pressing the release with one hand and jerking on the straps with the other.<br /><br />OVERALL- this is a ridiculously uncomfortable, behmoeth, or a pain in the neck seat and if I could just afford a new chair this thing would be out of my life so fast and I wouldn't miss it for a mili-second.",275,Yes,"Installation Type: Installation is difficult, especially on non-flat backseats; instructions for rear-facing install are ridiculous; installers used seatbelt instead of LATCH system; LATCH system causes belt to twist and release latch is hard to use.

1,5,4,0,2,,"Why we love it:<br />- SAFETY: 5-point harness keeps our 3-year-old more securely in the seat for longer (plan to use until 5 years old)<br />- LONGEVITY: converts to seatbelt booster for use up to 110 lbs/57 inches<br />- COMFORT: lots of padding, great for longer car rides<br />- easy to buckle, doesn't tangle<br />- great design with lots of detail stitching<br />- attached to latch system, so it doesn't slide around and is easy for child to climb into<br />- affordable at under 70 dollars<br /><br />After many hours of research online, comparing car seats in stores and ordering two car seats as &#34;finalists&#34; from Amazon, we have chosen this one for a number of reasons.<br /><br />The main consideration for us was keeping our 3-year-old in a 5-point harness seat for as long as possible, but not wanting to purchase a new seat in two years when she moves up to a seatbelt booster. We had to purchase a new seat for her now, because our second child is moving up into her old seat. Technically, our child meets the minimum requirements for a seatbelt booster now, but after reading a few discussion on this, it seems that with every seat &#34;upgrade&#34; (changing to forward-facing, then changing to seatbelt booster) you loose a layer of safety. In fact, even in our car manual it states that due to a child's anatomy, they recommend a 5-point harness until 5 years old (their skeleton isn't mature enough to &#34;properly&#34; handle a car accident if they are using a seatbelt booster this young).<br /><br />While safety was the biggest selling point for us to choose a convertible 5-point harness/seatbelt car seat, there are a few features that made this car seat stand out within this category. It is very nicely padded and the angle in the car is nice (not too steep or too upright), which makes for a comfortable ride. It's very easy to buckle, tighten, unbuckle, loosen and the straps don't tangle easily. This seat attaches to the latch system of the car, so it doesn't slide around when my 3-year-old climbs in the seat herself (this will be useful when we convert to the seatbelt function as well). As for any carseat that attaches via the latch system, you should check your car specs to see what the weight limit is for using a latch seat.<br /><br />I also love the colors — sleek and neutral but with a bit of custom stitching and hints of red that give some nice detail. My child loves the cup holders (I never knew she cared, but it's the first thing she noticed...) — they have an elastic band in the front which holds in the cup.<br /><br />The other seat we had ordered, but ended up returning is the &#34;Evenflo Chase LX Harnessed Booster, Jameson&#34; ([[ASIN:B016UJHJ8K Evenflo Chase LX Harnessed Booster, Jameson]]). The two models are very similar, the main difference was the amount of padding — the Maestro is just so much more comfortable, while with the Chase seat you could feel the hard plastic through the thinner padding.",520,Yes,"Seat Type: Convertible, Forward Facing

I finally got customer service to send a replacement, but it was the WRONG part. At that point, I super glued it and carried on. I'm not in the financial position to get a new seat - my father bought this for us. Next, the red piece at the bottom front of the seat (that changes the recline) broke off. It was stuck and I did not realize it - and I thought I wasn't pulling it right, so I pulled harder and it broke off. Now I can't ever change the recline again. It's stuck in a very upright position so my daughter's head lolls around when she falls asleep. On top of all the broken parts, I swear this thing weighs about 75 lbs. If you drive Uber, or ever need to take it in and out of the car, forget it. Also, the strap that holds the seat to the car is iMPOSSIBLE to loosen. We have another carseat - a $70 budget seat - which is much more durable and 100x easier to use. Do not recommend this Britax.

I wanted her to be able to stay in a 5pt harness, but still get the added features of a big girl seat.  So off to Target I went.  The display model stated the seat could be used from 2yrs +.  After much debate, I purchased it.  I had read on several other reviews here on Amazon that the seat had a small flaw...the crotch strap.  I really hoped this wouldn't be the case with us, but as other reviewers stated, it definitely posed a problem for us.  The crotch strap was digging into her legs and if she grows much more it won't work at all.  However, when we opened the box, it stated 3yrs+ on the instructions.

My husband has a Mazda 3 and had to put it forward facing otherwise it won't fit.

0,5,0,0,3,Fits 3 across,"For the price of these car seats, they need some serious work on installation and the instruction manuals.  We already own a pair of Chicco MyFits with the adjustable strap height, and it's a joke that at this price on the Radians you have to remove the seat and rethread the harnesses.  I thought they would save more space vs. the MyFits with the cupholders removed, but the two Dionos free up maybe a centimeter compared to the Chicco seats when side by side.  The rear tethers have clips that are too long, so it's really hard to tighten the tether when the anchor point is right behind the head rest.  Don't even think about traveling with these seats - they weigh a ton.  Also, the shock absorber thing you have to install when your child is forward facing and between 20 and 40 pounds is a bad idea because it's hidden after you put it in.  Who is going to remember to remove their car seat, take that thing out, and reinstall the seat a year later when their child is heavier?  Also, the instruction manual was vague as to whether to pop out the bottom angle adjuster thing for my child's weight.  All the installation videos on youtube contradicted the manual on this so I'm pretty sure most people are getting it wrong.  Lastly, what's the deal with no actual installation video on the Diono website?  Why bother having videos at all if all they show is how you open the seat from the box and offer generic tips like 'always read the manual'?  I'm watching the video because I can't follow your manual!",276,Yes,"Installation Type: installation and the instruction manuals, remove the seat and rethread the harnesses, rear tethers have clips that are too long, really hard to tighten the tether, shock absorber thing you have to install when your child is forward facing and between 20 and 40 pounds, remove their car seat, take that thing out, and reinstall the seat, pop out the bottom angle adjuster thing for my child's weight, installation videos on youtube contradicted the manual, no actual installation video on the Diono website

My son the one-year-old just outgrew the graco snugride infant seat.  My daughter was still using her Britax Marathons that we bought when she outgrew the graco.  We moved my son into the Britax seats, which are designed for babies up to 65 pounds.  First we tried the Graco turbo booster but that was too big and did not seem safe for my daughter, who just turned three and is only 29 pounds.  Then I found this seat, the Graco Nautilus, and I love it!  My daughter had wanted a girly print but once she tried her big girl seat with cup holders, she loved it and didn't care what color it was!  I offered to make her a girly pink cotton cover for it but she really doesn't care anymore what color it is.  We have been using the seats for a couple months now and are very happy with them.  They were also much more affordable than the Britax and seem just as sturdy and safe and well-fitting - a very good value that will be useful for many years.  We have old cars - a 10-year-old subaru forester and a 10-year-old VW Jetta - both without Latch - and it was easy to safely anchor in both cars using the seatbelt systems, and it fit well in both back seats.

1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel","Product Review: This inflatable booster worked great for us! My husband was quite skeptical but we both thought it was perfect, especially for traveling. My daughter is 6 but quite slim, and since she just clicked over the 40-lb. weight minimum for boosters, she is still in a convertible booster with a 5-point harness because I believe it's safer and she doesn't complain so why not?  However, we recently took an airplane trip and since we already had to travel with my younger son's carseat, we did not want to lug 2 full sized seats through airports. We decided since driving on our trip would be minimal once we got to our destination, to go with this booster. I'm so glad we did. It inflates and deflates like a breeze. It rolls up and fit in my daughter's backpack until we needed it. It was easy for her to use, comfortable to sit on, and the belt guides were easy to use and kept the seatbelt perfectly placed on her shoulder.<br /><br /> It will be perfect to keep in my car to use when we have an unexpected friend ride along with us because it's small and will fit nicely in the middle seat between our two very large Britax convertible seats, which hard boosters probably would not. I'd purchase again without hesitation.<br /><br />Warehouse Seller Review: I ordered this item as New/Like New from Amazon Warehouse Deals.

1,4,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel","Let me start off by saying I have a love/hate relationship with car seats.  I have 5 children, the oldest one is 7, so collectively, I probably have been through 30 car seats in less than a decade.  My daughter has been ready to graduate to a booster seat for 2+ years now, but unfortunately, due to her parents procreation habits, she's been relegated to life in a 5-point harness for lack of space.  It baffles me that mini-van manufacturers don't consider the fact that you may have kids in car seats.  Sure it's great Herb and Ethel sport their Chrysler Town & Country with their teacup poodle Miffy, but we use the heck out of our minivan.  So, when the twins showed up, the three bigs got kicked to the back of the bus and we panicked trying to cram three full seats in the back row.  Thanks to Radian (and $1000), we didn't have to buy a conversion van.  So, after squeezing every moment out of the &#34;baby&#34; seat, I had to find a narrow booster.  Our standard graco booster had birthing hips like my wife, and just didn't squeeze in the back.  Enter, Bubble Bum.  The name and concept are ridiculous, but, by golly, the thing actually works perfect.  I was EXTREMELY skeptical about a blow up seat.  Sure we want our children to live in a bubble, but to actually sit on one?  Low and behold, It fits her narrow booty perfectly and she's now all proud sporting a booster seat.  Granted, there are no frills to this thing.  No cup holder, no secret pockets, no fun stuff, just base model solidness.<br />We've had it probably a month and it's still inflated, and working great.  Thankfully we haven't done any crash testing in it, so I can't validate it's safety.  Hopefully, I'll never have to update my comment about the crash sturdiness.  Paranoia, I looked online and sites claimed it was safety checked and legit.  Now that school is starting back up, kid #1 is begging to be promoted in dad's car as well to a booster.  So, buying a second Bubble Bum.<br />Only negative thing I would say is my daughter complains the seat is &#34;itchy&#34; around the logo.  It is raised, and when she wears skirts or daisy dukes, she complained of scratching.  So, we improvised and she put a wash cloth on the seat.  I'm glad I didn't pay extra for kittens or something pretty on the seat only to have a dirty rag covering it.  Otherwise, works great.  If you're tight on space, it's definitely the seat for you.  I have one in our Odyssey and soon one in an Avalon (adjacent to two Radians).",453,Yes,"Seat Type: booster seat

I am also glad I got the slim fit since I have an Equinox and there is not much room in the back (we put the seat in the center).

For reference, I am 200lbs, so not a small person.)<br />Now my favorite parts are that the seat can easily have the height changed. I have a tall baby so that will be great to not have to keep getting taller seats or take a long time to adjust.<br />Also this car seat has been a blessing because baby (4 month old) will ride in this much longer before starting to get upset and even then she just gets a bit fussy. (I have one of those kids that hates the car seat!!) There are two adjustments for the back facing and one allows her to sit up more (which she loves!) as well as being able to kick her feet (and see her feet). We also have enough room to put one of those music kick pianos (strapped down) at her feet so she can have something to do during the drive since she is still learning her hands.<br />I appreciate that the cup holders can slide into itself because it would be uncomfortable for a passenger to ride next to the seat if they didn't since as I mentioned before, not much room as it is.<br /><br />I also like that the side padding next to her head is not touching the side of her head like in the pumpkin seat since that was another thing she didn't like (she would jerk her head side to side trying to get away from it). I still get the safety without her being unhappy.<br />Even though I can't take her in and out in the seat (which not like she liked that anyway), I really am glad I went ahead and got this one.

I plan to keep my daughter in the harness until she reaches 85 pounds and the belt-positioning booster until she is 12 or older.  I have taught her that safety is more important than ""image"" - I don't care that all of her friends are allowed to ride in cars with no booster of any kind.  The vehicle's seats and belts are NOT designed to protect your small riders.

My son just turned 6 and is still in the 5-point harness (note- harness can be used until your child is 65 lbs and 50 inches tall). I've had no problems getting this seat super tight using LATCH.<br />Last year my son threw up in this seat and it had to be taken apart and cleaned. It was irritating just like any other seat, but I put the whole cover in the machine and there wasn't any damage done to it. (The fabric and straps on this seat don't have any visible deformities despite it being over two years old.) When I did take it apart, it was nice to see how well padded it is.<br />One good thing, but also bad thing, about this seat is how wide it is. If you're not planning to put a third person in your backseat, it's not a big deal. However, my other son's car seat is a Recaro Proride (also notoriously wide) so any third passenger back there has to be either an older child or a very uncomfortable adult. The good thing about it being so wide is that it's comfortable for my son. On long trips he likes to cross his legs and will fall asleep that way.<br />The only other &#34;complaint&#34; I have about this seat is the cupholders. They are not plastic all the way around, but held by a strip of elastic, so something like a toy car is going to slide right out. Top heavy drinks have fallen out during turns.

2,3,0,0,2,,"It is difficult to get the straps to be even. The straps that come out near the leg are also part of the straps that go over the shoulder. This doesn't seem like a big deal until you have a squirming 1yr old you are trying to buckle in. When I try to pull on her shoulder strap to even them out it either pulls it too tight on her legs or her other shoulder. So what I usually end up with is one side of her body being too tight and the other being either the right tightness or too loose. It's not like I can tell a 1yr old to sit straight for a few minutes while I get you strapped in. It would be better of the leg/hip restraints were on a separate strap so each could be adjusted as needed without effecting the whole harness. This is the first car seat of this type I have had to buy, so maybe this how they all are or maybe I am doing something wrong, but it seems like they could change this part to make it a little easier to get them correctly strapped in.<br /><br />It is also a GIANT hassle to get it in and out of the car. When they (twins) were in the pumpkin style seats, we had Graco and the anchor straps had a button release system to tighten or loosen the anchor strap. This car seat has a tilt forward buckle, which in my experience, never loosens. So if I have to switch the car seats to my mom's car for example, I usually have to put a lot of downward pressure on the seat to give me enough slack to force feed the strap through the belt buckle to loosen the anchor strap enough to where I can unlatch the anchor hooks. I know this part isn't designed to be easy, to keep the seat in place in the event of a wreck, but the graco one was a forceful push of a button to allow slack on the anchor strap. I could swap both of my graco bases in less than 10 minutes, while it takes me 10-15 minutes each to wrestle with these to get them securely in the other car (and I never feel like I can get the anchor strap tight enough).<br /><br />Summary: If given the choice, I would not buy this again and if we had extra money, I would buy different seats and give these away.",423,Yes,"Harness Type: The straps are difficult to get even; the leg/hip restraints and shoulder straps are connected, making adjustment problematic.

I wasn't overly concerned with pricing but really wanted to get the seat that was the safest for him. It's such an overwhelming decision compared with the infant seat, which was a piece of cake. So many options.<br /><br />Consumer Reports gave this one the highest marks for safety so we went with it. I can now see however why it didn't score highest marks for ease of use.

They're just poorly thought out and make it a frustrating process to get your kid properly buckled into the seat.

There's a lot of cushioning, making the seat comfortable for the child. There is a latch in the front that adjusts the bottom of the seat, changing it from infant and toddler position. The latch is conveniently located in the front so you don't have to lift the entire seat to do it. Also, the head rest slides up a few levels, by pulling it up to the desired level- there is no removing and having to take anything off to adjust things. My favorite part is the straps, they can be adjusted to different level by pulling them up or down and making sure they snap at that level. That is so much better than removing the car seat and taking the straps out and re-adjusting them. You don't even have to take the child out of the seat to do this. Overall, it is a great car seat.",176,Yes,"Seat Type: infant and toddler position

This thing is built like a tank.  It means it's a fairly heavy seat, but that doesn't bother me.  It takes up less room front-to-back than the Pria did, and the install is insanely easy (especially compared to the Pria).  It's so easy to get a rock solid, perfect install on this with no wiggling--I love that.<br /><br />The fabric is high quality and is actually quite cool in the summer.

Major problem: her shoulders were too high for the five point harness, the shoulder straps of which were now just below her shoulders, but the car seat isn't supposed to be used as a booster seat with the car's seat belt until the child is 40 pounds. The car seat is useless until she grows, creating a gap in use.<br /><br />LATCH Problem: There is a secondary strap sewn to the main LATCH strap that keeps the LATCH strap looped through the correct part of the back of the seat, but in a Ford Focus, a Chevy Suburban and a Mitsubishi Montero it is in the way of properly tightening the strap so I had to use the car's seat belt and a locking clip in those cars.

So I'm no stranger to carseats and features.  This one had every feature important to me.<br /><br />The fabric is great.  T shirt type material, soft.  Lots of padding.  Which was important to me as we are very rural and baby needs to be in the seat for extended periods of time.  I had issues in the past with my babies fussing in other seats because they were hard and uncomfortable.  So I appreciate the extra comfort.  With that, I anticipate this seat to hold heat tho.<br /><br />One handed handle operation.  This is a great feature.  All too many times, mamas are holding a sleeping baby and trying to transfer to a car seat, only to find the handle forward as we juggle holding baby and trying to get a handle back with 2 hands.  The one handed operation is a timesaver. I've played with it enough that I dont foresee a problem accidently moving the handle.<br /><br />Adjustable crotch snap.  This feature is wonderful for a growing baby.  Too many carseats have the buckle set in one place and lil babies are slouching and bigger babies are pinched.  So to be able to move closer/further away with growth is a great security and comfort factor.<br /><br />No puzzle lock.  OMG...who's idea was that anyway?  I detest puzzle locks.  This one buckles in, straight, from each side without having to twist and turn the 2 buckles  together before inserting into the latch.<br /><br />The headrest and buckles seem to be easy to move.  Just a button to press and pull to adjust.  I've had too many carseats that straps had to literally be removed and rethreaded.  It's a pain.  I already appreciate the ease of adjustments with this one.  Same with the harness.  A button to press to loosen and tighten when putting baby in and removing.<br /><br />The boot.  I live in cold weather.  The boot is a great extra feature.  My complaint on this one...it doesnt securely attach.  Merely clips on.  I can already forsee it sliding.  So we will see.

It's easy to adjust, but I usually ""click"" it more than once. Don't rely on the ""click and safe"" feature to tell you when the straps are snug enough.

I called Graco and since it was brand new, they said to take it back to the retailer for a refund. Do not buy this.

The dual handles for adjusting the harness do take a little strength, not as easy as the one handed version, but still gets the job done.

We got the cheaper G4 for my husband's vehicle.  At first, I was regretting my ClickTight purchase.  This sucker is HEAVY.  I also felt that it was difficult to uninstall (tip on that later).  That said, it offers more cushion and side protection than the G4, so I stuck with it.<br /><br />Fast forward to a recent trip with a rental car...I wished that I had the ClickTight functionality with me.  We brought the G4, as it is lighter.  While it was nice not breaking our backs through the airport, I broke my back and more trying to install the dadgum thing in the rental car.  Even the LATCH anchors were a pain to click into the sedan (Toyota Corolla).  Then, I decided to move the seat to the middle and install with a seat belt.  It took 45 minutes, multiple crying jags, and several terse words thrown at my husband before I got an unsatisfactory install.  The ClickTight would have taken all of 3 minutes (yes, I've timed it now).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Incredibly easy install<br />-Comfy ride for kiddo<br />-Will last my kid for years<br />-Super safe<br /><br />Cons:<br />-HEAVY<br />-Can be hard to remove (made MUCH easier by putting a knee into the seat before twisting the ClickTight knob)<br /><br />If you want the ultimate in protection and ease of install, this puppy is for you.  If you plan on toting it through the airport regularly or from cab to cab, think again.  The heft isn't worth it.

Simply slide the strap loop end off the hook, pull through the back of the seat, stick it through the shoulder heighth you want, and then slide it back on the hook thing.  No complicated re-threading, and yet it's still a very secure connection.  Also very easy to tighten and loosen.  In fact, everytime I put my child in the carseat, I loosen the shoulder straps, buckle him in, and then tighten the straps around his shoulders.  It only takes a second, and I'm sure of a secure fit every single time.<br /><br />Comfort: This seat sits high.  If your car has low ceilings, maybe that would be a nuisance getting him in, but I'm putting my kiddo in the back of an extended cab 4door pickup which is very roomy.  The seat sitting so high off the bench makes it very easy for my son to see out the window.  He likes that.  The padding is comfortable and the seat is wide.  My toddler is average height & weight (50th percentile).  The seat also is angled back a little more than the Safety 1st one we had.  So if my son falls asleep, he is a little more comfortable.<br /><br />Safety:  This carseat feels sturdy.  The wings on either side of my toddlers head give me piece of mind about side impact.  The child sits more deeply in this seat than our old one, so I feel like he's better protected.<br /><br />Practicalilty:  This seat is easy to wipe down with a damp cloth.  The fabric doesn't hold crumbs.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Size:  This seat is huge.  It DOES fit in my Nissan Sentra, but it's huge.  I have 2 of these in the back of my nissan and you cannot use the 3rd seatbelt.  You also cannot put them right next to each other in the  Nissan, however you CAN put them next to each other in roomy cab of the pickup and I've put them next to each other in the back of a Suburban and they fit.  Also, if you want to use it rear-facing in a small car, you'll have to either use the center seatbelt or move the front seat really far foward to fit it on a side seatbelt.<br /><br />Summary:  If you have a larger vehicle, you can't go wrong with this seat.  Comfortable, easy to adjust, safe, and nice looking.  If you have a tiny car, you won't want to try to fit 2 of these in there.

My wife's you just clip on and it ratchets automatically as you put  weight on the seat. I would pay just about anything for a retrofit for one of those straps.

In general, this is a well built product with good looks and nice, comfortable material but it has an issue with the belt guide.  There is a long story here but the short version is that Diono has not worked out the problem with the belt guide (please note the date of my review) which doesn't reliably retract when a child leans forward and then back.  I bought two of these and they were both slow to retract, one worse than the other.  Diono sent me their ""fix,"" a new headrest with a supposed redesign.  The replacement headrests and belt guide looked identical to my eye but the company rep. told me her engineer inspected my emailed photos and could see the difference.  (I thought they sent me the old ones by mistake.)  So, I installed the new headrests.  One seat performed the same - okay just a little slow to retract.  The other performed much worse than the original, binding up and not retracting when my son leaned forward then back. After almost a month total of back and forth at this point, we had a long driving trip coming up in a few days so I decided to reinstall the original headrest.  It isn't perfect but it did better than what they called their ""fix.""  I am a safety person and I don't love that we have this product with a question surrounding it.  Buyer beware.  I wouldn't buy these boosters again.  Take a look at the difference between where the belt guide is for the Graco products and where they are for the Diono Monteray (tucked behind the headrest wings) and it will explain why the seat belt can't glide freely.  The Monterey would be a great product with the Graco belt guide design.<br /><br />Update:  6/19/12  I sent my two Diono Monterey seats back.  I may never see the $69 in return shipping but I figure my kids are worth more than that.  I ended up losing my last thread of confidence in the boosters after braking hard when a vehicle stopped short in front of me.  I asked my 5 year old son if he was okay and he said, ""My head almost hit the back of your seat, Mommy.""  That was it for me.

The Advocate itself was clearly well made. You can feel the sturdiness in it and the quality. I chose this particular model because of the extra side-impact protection. It is definitely on the wider side, so if you have an SUV or van, this seat is ideal. While this would still fit into a smaller vehicle, other passengers in the back might be a little cramped.

It took me nearly an hour to install this seat in my car (Prius). I purchased a seat cover too but soon discovered that the cover made the car seat slide so I removed it. In order to tighten the seat properly into the car, I had to climb into the seat. This was only possible because I'm petite. I do not know how someone larger than me could get at the right angle to secure the seat. The Extend2Fit feature is nice because my daugher's feet don't kick the seat. However, the trade off is that when fully extended, it pushes the car seat to the edge of the back seat. This in turn means that the front seat has to be pulled forward. I'm short so it wasn't too much of an issue for me. Might be better in a larger SUV or minivan. It is nearly impossible to properly tighten the harness. It tightens around my daughter's legs and is loose on her chest. The buckle strap is incredibly short. If you are used to the ease of use of the Chicco KeyFit 30 harness, you'll be very frustrated with this seat. Also, removing the padding to clean is a big chore. My daughter vomited in the car and I managed to contain it to just one area on the seat. But the process of removing the padding and harness was so difficult, it spread the vomit everywhere.

0,4,0,1,0,,"Maxi Cosi is high end European brand trying to make presence on the US market. I’ve seen some of their other products but  this car seat, Pria 3 in 1 tops it all off. Firstly this car seat is a TANK. It’s sturdy, it’s strong, it’s protective. So how do they do it? Infant to 10 years old? It’s a lot of padding. It’s customizable as other convertible seats we’ve seen, you remove the infant inserts to convert to toddler but adjustable head rest is what’s making it suitable for big kids. It’s quite brilliant actually. The seat itself doesn’t go through any adjustments so it’s still solid seat body that will protect the child in case of impact. Padding is DENSE, it’s not just soft cushion, it’s really dense and firm. It’s easy to install but it’s big, I wouldn’t recommend for the small car.

Our other car seats are noticeably lighter. This is great in terms of safety but if you need to switch the vehicles quite often you will get frustrated rather quickly. I didn’t find installation complicated, it’s about the same as the other seats but because of the weight it was harder and kinda felt like exercise.<br /><br />Everything about this car seat is premium, from fabric to buckle. It converts from infant carseat to booster and this easily done by adjusting<br />1. Recline<br />2. Backrest<br />3.Shoulder Straps<br /><br />Cushion is DENSE, comfortable but more importantly it feels as it can absorb some serious impact. I like to test my seats by tossing them against the concrete on my terrace, if it can’t take some abuse it’s not suitable for my child. Yes I did it. There was no clanking at all, just one loud thud.<br /><br />Suitable for kids from 4lbs newborn to 120lbs. How do they do it? Cushion, lots of it. Infant insert is beautiful and well packed and dense. Newborns can practically lay flat which is ideal and this is accomplished by a wedge behind the baby back. As the child is growing the seat offers 12 different headrest positions so the head will always remain protected.<br /><br />It’s the tank yet it’s slightly slimmer (on the sides).<br /><br />Mom tip: If you choose this seat for a newborn baby you will still need a way to put newborn in the stroller. Usually infant carrier cerseat is the way to go because you can take it from the vehicle and snap it in the stroller. You can’t do that with this carseat but if you get a stroller that converts into basinet you will not need infant carrier. That way when you take the baby out of this seat you can lay him/her flat in the stroller. Regular strollers don’t recline completely flat and are too spacious for newborn. Thankfully these convertible basinet strollers are the “thing” nowadays and pretty much every brand offers a variety of it.<br /><br />This way you can truly use one carseat until the child is 120lbs.<br /><br />I do recommend this seat.",410,Yes,"Seat Type: Convertible, infant carseat to booster

I also love the adjustable harness height which allows you to adjust as your kid grows taller without having to take the whole seat apart.

2,2,1,0,0,,"First of all, I'm an Art Director in advertising. So I understand doing things to make a product shot more appealing. But the photos of this seat are so misleading I felt I had to write a review. Let me start by saying, &#34;Shame on us&#34; in the first place. We were so overwhelmed at Baby's-R-Us by the over-abundance of options that we just went with a name we new and picked a color. So, I guess what I do for a living is working. I suggest you really explore these things at the store if you can. Also take this with a grain of salt as I'm a MAN and just expect things to work.<br /><br />In the photos (and even in the display model at the store) this seat appears very cushy. Padded. Even &#34;Snug&#34; in fact. However it has felt very flimsy and hard ever since we got it. There is nothing SNUG about how our baby sits in this seat.<br /><br />Yesterday we had a little &#34;blowout&#34; in the car seat (if you don't know what that is yet, you'll find out; Daddies of the world). In having to take all the &#34;cushions&#34; off, I realized just how bad this thing is. It's a hard plastic shell with a hard piece of Styrofoam. Assuming that's passable for the Crash Test Baby's, there's barely a baby blanket of padding in the actual seat cushions. The piece in the photo that appears to be a nice padded head restraint is a flat piece of junk that is not attached to anything and falls down behind our baby's back. It has less foam than the earphones on my 1982 Walkman and provides NO support around her head. Whenever she falls asleep, she is hunched over with a clear future with Daddy's chiropractor.<br /><br />This morning while re-assembling the &#34;pads&#34; (yes, I'm physically doing air-quotes while I tell this story) I decided it was finally warm enough to put away the fleece cover we'd bought and ad the canopy back on that came with the seat. Well, if this wasn't enough of a disappointing product in the first place, the canopy will make you wonder how this hasn't ended up in a sitcom already.<br /><br />As a man, and a gear-head I don't mind tinkering with things I want to modify or give MORE POWER (insert Tim Allen grunt), but when I buy something this simple, I expect it to just WORK. If I were to simply leave the handle in the carrying position (like in the fine photos of this product), this long-winded rant would not exist. But the Powers That Be in the world have made it very clear that the handle needs to be folded down while in the car and when you sit the car seat down... oh HEY, side note, speaking of The Powers That Be...<br /><br />I just realized this photo also doesn't show the 15+ CYA (Cover Your Ass) legal stickers and patches (in both English and Spanish) that are not only all over this seat including the cushions, but they are in no way REMOVABLE! So whatever beauty this thing might have had when it was designed is gone! But hey, at least there are plenty of reminders (in two non-removable languages) that Graco is just another behemoth company with a staff of attorneys that don't give a damn about the safety or comfort of my baby girl.<br /><br />So back to the canopy...You can't MOVE THE HANDLE when the canopy is on. It will only go part way back and nowhere near the  position required when you set the car seat down.<br /><br />In short (I know. I know)... for $140 I'm in the upper price bracket and expected to be in the higher quality bracket. You'd be FAR better off spending a little more for a much higher quality car seat, both for your sanity and your baby's comfort and safety.",661,Yes,"Material: appears very cushy, padded, snug; felt very flimsy and hard; hard plastic shell with a hard piece of Styrofoam; barely a baby blanket of padding; flat piece of junk; less foam; provides NO support; canopy; fleece cover; cushions; pads; 15+ CYA legal stickers and patches; non-removable

1,3,3,0,3,,"I bought this car seat almost two years after researching car seat safety for a long, long time. My granddaughter isn’t with me everyday but spends enough time with me that I need a car seat in my own car every day. When she was infant I used a Chico infant seat for her . It was fantastic and I really thought I’d purchase another Chico when she was ready for a bigger seat.<br />All my research led me to Britax and the Advocate. I wanted the safest seat I could get for her. I am not very handy, so I needed something easy too. The ClickTight sounded pretty perfect. So I decided to go with the Britax Advocate ClickTight, after reading every review I could find.<br />Let me say it is a heavy seat and I don’t like to move it around. That’s why I never move it unless there’s a great reason to do so. I was a little intimidated when I first tried to install in my car. When I felt frustrated I just went back to manual and even googled some things I couldn’t quite picture. Installation and adjustment was amazingly simple!<br />Every time I need to adjust, I refresh my memory with a quick google video or the Manuel and it’s so easy...once again, let me tell you I am not good at this type of thing. My only problem getting baby in seat has been when she’s being playful and won’t sit still so I can buckle her.<br />It does take two hands to fasten and unfasten the belts on her seat but that just keeps her safer, in my opinion- meaning she can’t get out by herself.<br />I’ve washed the cover and replaced it on seat.  I did get really confused at one point and thought, “this is crazy! This can’t be right!” When I read instructions on replacing cover. Well, after I reread a couple of times I realized I was trying to put the cover on the wrong place. Yep, it was me doing it wrong! After two years I just can’t say anything bad about this seat. Thankfully, we haven’t been in any accidents so I can’t speak to that. I love this seat, even two years later.

Material and workmanship both seem very nice and honestly we wouldn't be concerned about carrying our daughter around in it now that she's a year and a half old.<br /><br />We weren't thrilled with other aspects of the seat. We use the LATCH system, and was disappointed that this uses the old clipping mechanism instead of the newer quick release straps. If you're moving this between cars a lot, this will definitely slow you down. We also felt like the seat was a bit TOO spacious for a very young infant. There wasn't nearly as much lateral (side to side) support with this seat as there was with our chosen seat. Our daughter was born under 5 pounds, and even when she was 5 pounds, I wouldn't trust putting her into this seat until she got over 12 pounds or more. Just feels like there's too much wiggle room - even using the inserts.<br /><br />We also felt like the cupholders were an odd choice. They aren't terribly deep and the elastic, while being a clever idea, just didn't work as well as a good, deep cupholder.<br /><br />As far as the comfort goes, our girl seemed to like it, but we didn't really notice any difference in the ""comfort mesh"" than with any other seat we've tried.

0,1,0,2,0,,"I used to not be a huge fan of this carseat; however, after extended use, my opinion has really changed. I now LOVE this carseat!<br /><br />When I was first researching an infant carseat to purchase, I went back and forth between the Gracco Snugride and the Chicco Keyfit. I ended up choosing this Chicco mainly because it seemed much more comfortable than the Gracco (and more attractive). Well, I'm glad I did for numerous reasons. First of all, it really does seem like a very comfortable carseat. Our son has even spent a few nights in it when he has had a cold and couldn't lay flat comfortably in his crib. On those rare occasions he sleeps soundly for 12 hours and always wakes up happy. That tells me that the carseat must be pretty comfortable. He is also always very happy in his carseat, and doesn't get fussy when we are out running errands and such.<br /><br />Also, the release button that lets the straps in and out is a Godsend! Also, I like that even though it is a 22 pound carseat, it still holds a baby up to 30 inches. Some of the competitors 22 pound seats only go up to 26 inches. Therefore, I expect that our 7.5 months old (who is very tall) should be able to stay in it for another month or two. Just for reference, this carseat should be technically be able to hold even the largest babies, for up to 6 months. 22 pounds and 30 inches is above the 95th percentile for a 6 month old baby.<br /><br /> I've also had some experience carrying infants in other carseats, and I'd say this one is much lighter and easier to handle. At 17 pounds, our son is starting to get a little too heavy to carry around in the carseat, so I'm glad we did not go with a larger 30 pound seat. I can't imagine carrying around a baby that heavy in a carseat!<br /><br />The only thing that I still don't like about this carseat is that it doesn't have that little notch on the bottom that allows it to fit into the front of shopping carts. Also, it didn't seem to fit our son very well when we took him home from the hospital at 5 pounds. We ended up folding up a burpcloth and putting it behind his back for the first few months.

0,3,3,0,3,,"I was a Britax-only person until I received this. Concept is awesome, but it doesn't work the way it's designed. The idea is to lift the seat cushion of the car seat to full opening, pull the seatbelt across the opening and buckle in, then close the seat. Sounds easy right? It's not. If you pull the seatbelt tight before you close the seat cushion, it will not fully shut because the seatbelt blocks the seat from fitting into place. You have to leave the seat belt loose and then shut the seat. But then when you try to pull it tight, it only tightens one of the layers of the folded belt. The top layer is pulled taut, but the bottom layer remains loose with slack no matter how hard you try. This, to me, is very dangerous.<br /><br />Secondly, the loosening and tightening of the harness straps is very irregular. One will loosen while the other will not, the one that does loosen does not loosen fully, and the straps constantly get uneven where one is loose, but I cannot tighten anymore on my daughter otherwise the other strap will hurt her and be too tight.<br /><br />Lastly, there are rubber guards on the chest connector that always slide down and refuse to remain in place. It becomes a huge hassle when trying to move the chest connector up to its correct position. I'm worried the guards move the chest connector down out of position, too.<br /><br />So not only is the design a poor execution and incredibly difficult and inconvenient to maneuver but it's faults make the seat unsafe.

Seems like false advertising… If I had known that I probably wouldn’t have bought it. I have two Graco slim fit lx (also sold by Walmart under a different name- true fit 3 I think?) that you can just snap off the bottom cover to wash - so easy. Be sure when you wash the diono that the velcro is velcroed because otherwise it will destroy the mesh lining.<br /><br /> What I really like about this Diono is how spacious it is for the kid - they can push down the sides around the thighs and move around, and no giant things around the head, so they can look around. Whereas the gracos really close them in. I also love that it can be folded for storage! And the pink is so cute! The other downside is that the shoulder strap height has to be adjusted manually (have to at least partially uninstall the seat to access the straps) whereas the Graco adjusts the shoulder straps with the click of a button while installed. The slim profile on the diono is visually pleasing and if the kids aren’t in the car I can haul more stuff on top of this seat as opposed to the gracos. I have a civic and they all fit 3 across.<br /><br />I have it forward facing for my older kids as would have to buy the diono angle adjuster to get it to take less room rear facing. So I put the Graco rear facing for my toddler as it takes up less front row room while rear facing.<br /><br />Lastly i like that to uninstall the latch you pull a ribbon loop as opposed to pressing a button.

At 4 months old, he grew out of our infant carrier and we needed a larger seat but still keep him rear facing. This was a great, inexpensive (comparatively) option that we feel confident with to keep our child safe.<br />We have a Toyota Camry and because we’re both so tall, our seats are pushed all the way back. This car seat almost fit behind the passenger seat. If we moved the seat up an inch or so, it would fit easily behind the passenger. Because we do a lot of traveling and like to keep the seat all the way back, we did move the car seat to the middle so it wasn’t touching the seat in front and there’s plenty of room. Our son is 28” and so far we haven’t had to use the leg room extender, but we love that it has that option!<br />Using the latch system, the seat is super easy to install! Using the seat belt method, it was definitely a little trickier, but it wasn’t impossible.<br />The only downside is that because of the cupholders, while rear facing, it is a little wide. A booster seat may fit next to it, but definitely not another car seat.

0,7,1,0,5,,"Overall this car seat gets the job done. I previously had a Chicco and chose this carseat because it's the lightest carseat around and I loved the the color options. My review is mostly comparing the two.<br /><br />Pros: It's light.<br /><br />It's good looking.<br /><br />Snaps easily in and out of the base.<br /><br />Cons: It's very long. Whoever sits in front of this car seat has an uncomfortable ride because they will have to pull their seat so far forward.<br /><br />It's awkward and uncomfortable to carry. There's no padding on the handle and it's hard to carry for longer than a run from the parking lot to the cart.<br /><br />The canopy doesn't move easily, is floppy, and sometimes gets in the way of locking it into the base. Due to the stiffness in moving it I am now the proud owner of a replacement because the canopy hub cracked and wouldn't hold the canopy up.<br /><br />The strap to tighten or loosen the harness is also awkward. You push it down, but to get good leverage on it you end up holding down the very strap that you are trying to loosen. On that note, it's also difficult to tighten.<br /><br />When I called for a replacement part for the canopy I was told that there is no replacement but since it was still under warranty I'd get a replacement. Cool. In order to get a replacement I needed to send in 5&#34; of the safety strap, a 5&#34; square of the pad, and the serial sticker and once they received those they would send me the new seat. Wait, what? You don't have a second car seat? Then they charge you a hefty deposit that they will refund once they receive those items from you. Seems slightly wasteful to destroy a perfectly good car seat that has a cracked canopy hub.<br /><br />If I had to choose a carseat all over again I'd go back to the Chicco (which is only 1lb heavier) for ease of use, functionality, and ability to fit in our vehicles (out of our Pontiac G6, Chevy Avalanche, and an old Mercedes we all fit comfortably in none if them).

0,5,4,0,1,,"Updated 5/2020:<br />A year later - still not great but fine enough. I do like the cup holders built into the seat arms. We now have another car seat next to this one and both cup holders are still useable, whereas one of the the flip up cup holders on the Nuna are now blocked by the second car seat. But otherwise, it’s still awkward for him to sit in this seat at almost 3. If I could have gotten two Nuna I would have.<br /><br />Updated 7/29:<br />Now using daily and I am no longer a fan of this car seat. The straps are lopsided - one tightens more than the other, can’t resolve, and I’m sure one loose strap isn’t safe. The straps have to be really low behind his back for his head to be in the “head area”. If straps are at a comfortable, normal spot on his shoulder, the “head area” is above his head. Other reviews mentioned this, but the buckle is so short, it’s hard to buckle the straps and not catch his clothing, legs in it. Argh!<br /><br />Updated 5/29:<br />We have now flown with this car seat on an alaska airlines flight, and installed it in two cars. Used a car seat dolly in the airport and with a 25 lbs kid it was just fine as a “stroller”. The car seat fit just fine on the window seat with the arm rest up between it and my middle seat (I am 5’10” and sat comfortably next to it).<br /><br />Somewhat difficult to install in the cars because we can’t get the seatbelt tight without the car seat being incredibly lopsided. The bottom harness straps are really awkward and wide - instead of going straight to the back, they go wide and cover his legs. Not sure how to explain this any better but it’s really weird, seems uncomfortable, and maybe not safe?<br /><br />Original review: Purchased it because we needed a second one for another car, and to use after he maxes out of his primary seat.<br /><br />Graco may allow for rear-facing longer (I hope - you never know with height, and I’m not sure if or how the leg extension will work). The Graco extends higher than MCM and is easier to install. Graco seat looks more comfortable - it’s flat, whereas the MCM dips down quite a bit. The MCM was slightly “beefier” and I liked that the side impact was also adjustable - but hard to say how child will fit in this car seat later so I liked the backless booster option on the Graco as opposed to possibly having a high-back seat that is very uncomfortable or not useable for older child. They have the same height limit,  but Graco becomes backless booster 100-120lbs, MCM is high back to 120lbs. The cup holders on the MCM were small, I couldn’t fit the Thermos funwhatever bottle. The Graco cup holders pull out quite easily, toddler enjoys doing this...sigh. I don’t think the Graco fabric/color chooses are attractive, but can live.<br /><br />Purchased May 2019. The Graco seat was manufactured in Feb 2019, the MCM in December 2018 (I was worried discounted price = much older seat).<br /><br /> It was hard to choose, as they are similar prices, but other reviews of the seats helped me (Graco rattling noise?

It’s lucky that the seat stays put, because I wouldn’t want to do that again, and it’s certainly stopped me from buying another of this brand for the person who will be watching my son while I’m at work; she is older and would be unable to put the seat back in her car once it’s removed.

I had the original gogobabyz  which I used with my oldest child when he was a toddler but it didn't fit my new larger britax seat, so I bought this britax cart, thinking it would be better because it was made by the company.  On taking it out of the box, it looked like a ""dolly"" you would use to carry boxes.  The latch attachments clip to these rectangular fixtures on the base and it sits a bit high off the ground (several inches).  It felt a little unstable despite the fact that the seat was secured we'll to the cart.  The issue seems to be the center of gravity being higher.  Also when taking my child on a little test run around the house, when we rounded the bend into the kitchen, the latch attachments shifted to the side of the rectangular attachments and the whole seat tipped over.  I figured I needed to install it like in the car, with more pressure. So I decided to tryit on the trip anyway.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I emailed gogo babyz to see if they had a kit to make my old travelmate fit one of my kids marathon car seats.  They did not have a retrofitting kit so they sent me a new travelmate that would fit my larger britax car seat - this is 6 years after I bought the original travelmate!  That is some seriously unusual customer service!  The car seat I installed quickly and felt very secure.  It sits right on the floor and is quite stable.

First, with all of the stuff on the harness straps (HUGS chest pads, shoulder pads) it is very difficult to get the straps tight enough to be safe. You really have to pull on it hard to get the straps to tighten up.  Second, it is difficult to reach the place you have to push to release the harness straps and your child.  The good thing about this is that your child will never be able to take off her harness herself.  But it is difficult for mom to reach, too.

I actually bought the Recaro Pro-Ride first.  When installed forward facing, it is a tank. You child will be protected.  My daughter, though, is not ready to ride forward-facing yet. So, I needed this to rear-face for a bit.  I could not get the Recaro to safely install in a rear-facing position in my Volvo XC90.  (See my review of the Recardo Pro-Ride for more info.)  I ended up returning the Recaro and getting the Britax Marathon 70-G3. This seat installed wonderfully in my car in the REAR facing position.  No noodle was needed.  It has a strap for the rear facing position that lets you connect the top of the seat to the floor of the car, which prevents tipping, which I really like.  It is nice and comfy and soft for the baby.  It has these plastic covers on the straps, that make it hard to get the straps tight if your baby is tiny, but you can get it to work.  I will say, though, that the Britax head proection is not as good as the Recaro.  Plus, the Recaro is deeper - your baby sits down in it more, so they are more protected from side impact.<br /><br />Bottom line for me:  This is a great seat for REAR facing.

The provided straps are just webbing, and There was no way we’d use them for more than a minute.

You’re better off using some bungee cords to strap it to the handle of rolling luggage if you’re going very far.<br /><br />We gate checked it for our flights but you may be able to put it in an overhead bin.<br /><br />Since the back does not detach, it’s easy to quickly install and remove from an Uber. I had trouble getting the isofix latch connectors to work in one Uber (Toyota sienna, I believe) but it was a short ride so we went without them completely attached.<br /><br />We also like that the sides of this seat expand like the other Monterey models because my son is tall with a long and wide torso and would likely have cramped shoulders by the time he ages out of a standard booster seat. What I didn’t realize until we got it is that the width expands as you raise the headrest, not independently like the other models.<br /><br />Overall we like it but unless you’re planning some travel that includes Ubers and/or flights where you’ll rent a car or ride with family/friends on the other end, save your $$.

I was hoping that the Traveling Toddler would be great, but I found that it too much torque and stress on the suitcase. To add the weight of my car seat (a Britax) and my 22 pound 1 year old was just too much weight for the handle of the suitcase. It felt awkward and unstable. The physics of it just did not work. So, we put the seat in a bag with wheels and dragged it behind us. The bag was also better for our trip because we fly stand-by and wait and see what seats are left. There was no more window seats available on one of our flights, so we gate checked the seat and I was happy to know that it was protected.",156,Yes,Weight Range of Child: 22 pound 1 year old

I work in law enforcement and their father is in EMS so unfortunately, we are exposed to how tragic traffic collisions can become without the proper child restraints. I am hoping to become certified in the next few weeks as a CPST. With my research, I discovered that the key is a proper installation and because of this, I decided that I would buy a separate seat for each of my 2 children in each of the cars we routinely drive as well as their grandparent's vehicle. For my son who is 3.5 years old, I have owned several seats ranging from a basic Cosco front facing seat to Graco convertibles to Britax convertibles. My daughter is 7 months old and recently began to outgrow her Peg Perego infant seat. I decided to begin transitioning her to this seat in my primary vehicle and plan to purchase a couple more convertible car seats for the other vehicles over the next couple of months. I could not be happier. She is in the middle seat of my 2015 Nissan Pathfinder so I had to use a seat belt installation instead of LATCH. This made me super nervous as I was concerned about getting a secure seatbelt install, but the click tight technology has been very user friendly. She seems to be very content in the seat and a good fit.

The bag has enough space for a neck pillow and even some pampers lol.<br />The only thing I would have liked is if it had a head strap for when the child is asleep because my daughter’s head was slumped over. I ended up buying a head strap from Amazon and it fits around the car seat perfectly. So with a combination of her neck pillow and head strap she’s good to go!<br />The other gripe is that I got approached by the stewardess a few times on connecting flights to ensure the car seat was flight approved and I had to point to the tiny airplane symbol on the car seat.

2,7,0,0,3,Washable FabricRemovable Seat Cushion,"Extremely disappointed and will probably NEVER own Britax again!  I am a twin mom that immediately purchased B-Safe carriers for my twins, the double B-Agile stroller, then when they turned 11 months old I purchased them both Pavilion 70-G3 convertible cowmooflage print car seats. I loved most everything about them until yesterday.<br />We went on a road trip over the weekend and one of my girls got a little car sick. We had cleaned it all up but I wanted to wash the entire cover when we returned home to ensure it was clean. When we removed the cover we found that the head restraint 'wings' were severely cracked, like nearly torn off. So we checked the other car seat immediately and found that both sides were completely broke off. This really stressed me out knowing my kids were just on a car trip in these seats and the totted safety features are completely broken.<br />I started calling Britax this morning and their phone number was temporarily unavailable. I finally got through this afternoon and was told my seats are outside of the 1 year warranty but that I could buy new wing pieces. I told her that the seats are minimally used, my toddlers do not fight getting into them and we have never had an accident. She informed me that they are made of the same foam that is in your cars bumper and are made to break. I said but this is less than normal wear causing them to break, not an accident. She told me the car seat was fine without them but that I would have to pay to replace them.<br />So if you are looking to buy a car seat and reviewing the extra safety features that make Britax sound like they are worth all that extra $$$$, think again. Those features are meant to break and may have never been keeping my children any more safe than the Chicco or Graco's. What a bunch of misleading marketing or a really great way to ensure they continue to suck money out of you from the constant purchase of replacement parts!<br />My children do not go in the car daily and sometimes only once per week.

2,3,3,0,3,,"This seat gave us 17 months of infrequent use before the Clicktight (CT) feature rendered the seat unusable. Because we don't have a dedicated vehicle and instead use car-and ride-sharing services, knowing we would be able to safely, correctly, and quickly install a seat with a standard seatbelt in any vehicle, anytime, anywhere was what sold us on the Marathon CT. We were willing to pay more for the CT feature and lug this beast of a seat into Ubers and Zipcars, through airports, and on planes because we believed its quality and supposed ease of use was worth the extra weight and hassle. We still stood behind this seat when its quirks started showing (the harness tension was always slightly uneven no matter how many times we reset it; the harness adjustment area became a repository for crumbs and curious fingers; the selected recline angle was deceiving and would usually decrease once the CT system was engaged; the lower harness straps sometimes left marks on my child's legs; and so on).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the CT system proved to be the demise of this seat. More often than not, the CT dial would only partially engage when I pushed the panel down with my hands, especially when all slack was removed from the seatbelt as instructed. Instead of clicking shut, the panel would bounce off a taut belt. A gentle kneel was almost always needed to fully lock or disengage the CT panel. The seat also was difficult to rear-face in our preferred rear center position in certain vehicles, with multiple attempts needed to ensure a no-budge install.<br /><br />While attempting to install the Marathon CT rear-facing in the rear center position in Toyota sedan last weekend, I encountered my typical issue of the panel not fully engaging when pushed down. I gently kneeled on it to click it shut and the dial became displaced under the panel, making it inoperable. Because we were away from home at a special event, I looked for other ways to install the seat without using CT and found that using LATCH on this seat is (1) absolutely horrendous and (2) impossible to achieve safely without having a functional CT panel, as the LATCH belt path runs under it. We were grateful to make it home safely by doing a makeshift LATCH installation in an outboard seat (kind of like how you attach a seat to the Britax wheeled travel cart, which incidentally ALSO broke the same day - so much for Britax quality!). The LATCH belt was very difficult to loosen and it took 15 minutes for my spouse and I to remove the seat from the car. Worst of all, the seat is no longer safe to use.<br /><br />I have since looked for information in the installation manual as well as on Britax's site about whether kneeling on the CT panel during installation is acceptable and have found nothing discouraging or forbidding it.

We have used, abused and relied upon mountains of, and thousands of dollars worth of different &#34;Kid Gear&#34; throughout the years.  This is my second Britax car seat now.<br /><br />This item is a good one to invest in.  It isn't the cheapest, but as a former police officer, I will tell you, don't cut corners on getting a safe car seat for your child even though they are overpriced.  And make sure it is anchored properly!  No car seat is safe if it is not anchored the right way.  Pull the belt out all the way and crank that dang thing in there tight.  Your kid is worth more than the leather on your back seat.<br /><br />This seat is bulky but rated well for impact.  It has good anchoring options and instructions too.  The only criticism I have besides the cost (I'm sure the mark up on car seats is huge!), is the belt clips under the cushioning are too tight.  If you anchor the seat in tight, there is no way those plastic clips will snap in place.  This could lead a consumer to think those weak clips will hold the seat to the actual seat belt.  Not true; even if they improve those clips.  And on a shoulder belt, those clips are worthless.  Add clearance to the clips and that would be great, or just get rid of them.<br /><br />And by the way, this seat is designed so you don't have to have your wife or another one of this kids with tiny hands to thread the belt through the seat.  My recommendation is, don't buy this seat from Target or Walmart, it is not the same seat!  Pay the shipping and get this exact model.  Priced right for the quality in comparison to the others.

Also, the obvious, easy to travel with and move from car to car.<br /><br />Main issues that I read were:<br />- Seat-belt positioner on each side (red ear thingies), locking and folding mechanism: I agree that it is somewhat of an annoyance that you often need to pull the latch on the bottom to readjust their width. They would have been perfect if you also needed to use the latch to retract them, but it is something I learned to accept. Extra 5 seconds is not a big deal in my opinion.<br /><br />- Seat-belt positioner on each side (red ear thingies), inner hook: This is to prevent the belt from sliding out. I admit that it takes some practice to get used to handling these (my wife still cant), but I like that it is this way because the kids also cant play around with it and unbuckle themselves at will.

But once set, they stay and are not a problem.<br /><br />- Sliding off the seat: I only found this issue when trying it with kids that are under the required height.

1,5,2,3,0,"Includes LATCH connectors that attach to vehicle, keeping the booster seat secure when not in use., The backrest on the Viaggio HBB 120 can be removed for easier travel and transport.","I'm a car seat psycho (for safety) and I've tried multiples of every version of seat (infant, convertible, HBB...) to find the very best of the best. After 3 different HBBs, this Peg Flex is the holy grail. Here's why:<br /><br />It doesn't have arm rests so your kid can actually do the buckle unassisted. This is huge because you go from a kid that can do their convertible seat straps to a kid that needs to be assisted in finding the buckle every.single.time. in every boosterthat has arm rests. This seat and the Maxi Cosi Rodifix are thus winners in this category.<br /><br />The Flex has a more narrow footprint than others because it doesn't have armrests. Need 3 kids to ride? Need 2 to sit next to one another? You're golden. You can park the Flex next to a variety of seats without issue. I have one next to a Nuna Pipa and a Clek Foonf in a Land Rover Discovery (which doesn't have the broadest back seat).<br /><br />The Flex adjusts in 4 directions so your picky big kid can decide exactly how the seat is best for them.<br /><br />As with all Peg Perego products, the fabrics are OUTSTANDING. We have the &#34;licorice&#34; version of the Flex, which is a combo of really soft, highly padded fabrics touching the body and edges with really gorgeous leather finished with white top stitching. This seat isn't more expensive than its competitors, buy it looks and feels like it should be. Super gorgeous, even if you have a luxury car-quality interior.<br /><br />This seat &#34;makes my buns feel the happiest of any car seat I've ever had!&#34; per my 7 year old. If that isn't a rousing endorsement, I don't know what is.<br /><br />The seat belt shoulder clip is well-designed so that the belt easily pulls through and retracts without issue (this was a constant issue with the RodiFix, the Oobr, and, to a lesser extent, the Britax Parkway in both my Honda Odyssey and the Discovery).<br /><br />The folding mechanism seems like a &#34;so what&#34; feature, but is actually really handy. I've used it a handful of times in only a few weeks as I've found myself suddenly needing cargo room. I just remove and fold up the Flex, park it on the front floor, and collapse it's 2nd row seat. Super easy and quick. The latch release and install lever is also delightfully straightforward to use.<br /><br />All in all, there isn't anything to complain about with this seat. Not even the little pull out cup holders. They're not indestructible, but most European-made seats don't even offer an add on option (like the RodiFix).

So we went with Evenflo Brand again with the Discovery.<br /><br />I do like how it is rated for a little bit bigger child up to 22lbs / 29"" vs the 20lb / 26"" limit on the Portabout.  Both my boys have been big (9+lbs and one almost 23' long at birth) So the infant carseat won't work for them for too long.<br /><br />I never had a problem with either handle not staying where it was supposed to.<br /><br />Discovery is a bit harder to manuver a sleeping baby in and out of the car.  The hook on the front of the carseat needs to be tipped forward to hook in, then the back snaps down, so if baby is sleeping they are tipped forward to get hooked in. The portabout didn't have to be tipped as severly forward because there wasn't a hook it needed to hook into.  Some claim the Portabout was hard to get in and out, I never experienced this.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have with the Discovery is the flat piece that holds the 2 straps together tends to slide down.  I follow the instructions to slide it up to Baby's armpits height, but even if he's sleeping that piece slides down to about his stomach area, in a short 5 mile car ride.  I would say the seat would be greatly improved and rank a 5 star if they just replaced the sliding connector with the plastic clip one they used in the Evenflo Portabout.  Wherever I slide that one into position I find it stays put.  Personally I found a new base for the Portabout on the web and have ordered it.  I'm going to go back to the Portabout carseat.  The connector concerns me that if I were in an accident, I am not convinced he would stay in the seat very well.

1,4,4,2,3,Adjustable,"The cart itself looks and feel sturdy - but there are other more practical options that are just as well made and more well priced. The key - and only - selling point for this cart is that it will fit down a narrow airplane aisle. While I have never needed to use it on an airplane, I am certain this claim is factually true. However, one needs to worry more about the child car seat than the actual cart, as the average child car seat is wider than the cart itself...<br />Be advised that the cart uses rollerblade wheels. Anyone who has ever roller bladed *knows* that such wheels are intended for FLAT, SMOOTH surfaces. Airports provide plenty of such surfaces, but it is getting to the airport where this cart is useless. One needs to walk super slow and needs to be ultra careful to avoid every bump, crack, twig, etc to not send the cart and any cargo strapped to it flipping over to its side. In my case, it's only been an empty child car seat that has been sent tumbling over. No one got hurt, but it was an embarrassing inconvenience as you have to stop and readjust and clean everything before resuming your trip at a slow plodding pace.<br />I have since (quickly) replaced this crappy britax with a less expensive luggage cart from PFC. The luggage cart has larger wheels and a wider base, about as wide as the child car seat at its widest point. This makes for a much more stable and reliable transport option, one where I can walk at a much more natural pace.<br />Final note: It is much easier to secure the child car seat to the pfc luggage cart than it is to the britax. This is due to the fact that the pfc is wider and it is easier for the security latches to reach the brackets by the cart's wheels.

0,3,0,0,0,,"We purchased the Graco ComfortSport at Target in Sept of 2010 as an emergency replacement for our previous carseat after an accident. (We actually got the Creighton model.) I have 3 major concerns about the safety of this seat:<br /><br />1) The shoulder straps do not tighten evenly. After looking at the back of the seat I realized this is due to the design of the set yoke; most seats have two individual hooks for the shoulder belts, tightened by a single pull strap. The ComfortSport overlaps the two shoulder straps under a single hook and one strap will always be a little looser than the other. This also crates the potential for the overlapping strap to slip out of the hook, as it is barely held in place by the hook.<br /><br />2) The chest plate is easy to unbuckle, even for young children. I looked up advice on how to solve this issue on Graco's website- apparently many parents were having the same issues and Graco's response was that parents should just explain to their children why they need to keep the belt on. After pulling over 10+ times on a two-hour trip because my 2 year old didn't understand my explaining on why this belt was intended to keep him safe, I settled on buying self-adhesive Ace wrap to wrap around the buckle so he couldn't mess with it.<br /><br />3) The tightening plate on our model broke after only 11 months of use. I was tightening the strap, as usuall, and the single screw the holds the plate in place pulled out and flew somewhere in the car. If this had happened during an accident, the shoulder straps would have been loosened about 2 inches and greatly reduced the protection of the seat.<br /><br />I had contaceted Graco regauding my concerns about the seat, and asking for a refund. They sent me a letter stating that if I had problems with their product, I should ship it to them at MY expense and they would replace the seat with another one of the same model- no refund.

4,4,0,1,0,,"For so long, my girlfriend and I have been needing to upgrade our child's carseat. Being that our child's legs are long, it helps to keep them lower and allows them to hang freely and not be pressed up uncomfortably against the back of the passenger seat. The cup holders, armrests, and fact that our child can use an actual seatbelt are all added bonuses.<br />We often go for long car rides and adventures through the mountains, so this really is made for comfort as our child has fallen asleep countless times in just the short span that we've owned it. It looks safe, is incredibly light-weight, feels, and looks cool. As our child gets taller, the back support can rise and even come off and simply transition to a booster seat. Being able to wash it all also makes it so much more durable and clean. We are extremely excited that the latches for the base/booster seat are so easy to clip in and take off. With our previous setup, it was a chore, but this has been nothing but a delight and smiles all around.<br /><br />For what it's priced, my family and I truly feel this is an excellent product designed to ensure safety, comfort, style, and ease of use for the adults and kids alike.

1,5,0,0,0,Washable FabricCup HolderWashable FabricCup Holder,"When my daughter was close to outgrowing her car seat, we purchased this seat and the Graco Nautilus to see which one was better for us.  The Britax Frontier, in my opinion, is a higher quality and more desirable seat.<br /><br />The biggest thing that stood out immediately when we were adjusting the straps in both seats was that my daughter, who was 2 at the time, already needed the bottom strap with the buckle to be set in the last slot to be a comfortable fit for her in the Graco seat.  In the Britax seat, we only needed to put the buckle in the 2nd slot, with plenty of room to grow.  I knew I wanted to leave her in the harness as long as possible instead of switching her to the booster as soon as she hits the minimum weight, as many parents do.  Since she was already in the last slot at age 2, I am sure that she would've ended up sitting on the strap instead of having it come down just in front of her as it should.  I know this wouldn't be comfortable if the straps were tightened appropriately and it really doesn't seem all that safe.<br /><br />The next advantage of the Britax seat vs the Graco seat was the method to adjust the height of the harness shoulder straps.  In the Britax seat, you just push a button on the back of the seat and pull the headrest up.  On the Graco seat, you have to completely unthread the harness straps and rethread them in the higher slot.  This isn't really hard, admittedly, but it is a pain in the butt and Britax's system is so much easier.<br /><br />The installation of the Britax seat is not as easy as that of the Graco.  The angle of the belt path and the LATCH system buckle is awkward.  What I've found works is actually getting into the car, putting a knee in the seat and using my weight to push the seat tightly against my car seat while I tighten the straps.  This is the only way I've been able to get a really secure fit.  I cannot pull the straps tight enough to keep the seat from wiggling more than the recommended 1"" without using my weight to push the seat down first.  I drive a full sized SUV so I have plenty room to do this but it might be pretty awkward in a smaller vehicle.<br /><br />The cupholders on the Frontier are fantastic.  It is so nice to have one for a drink and one extra for a snack, or a toy, or whatever.  Really, it seems like a small thing but it does make a big difference.  I often bring along an extra small cup to hold snacks neatly in the cupholder.  A snack in a cup in a cupholder is much, much less messy in a car than a snack held in a small child's lap.  The Nautilus had some very cool secret compartments in the arm rests that my daughter really loved but I, personally, prefer the functionality of the cupholders.<br /><br />The HUGS system that holds the chest straps in place seems pretty gimmicky to me.  I don't think that they help all that much.  I still have to adjust the chest buckle every time I buckle my daughter in and it is kind of annoying to have to adjust the HUGS thing, too.  I also accidentally pinched the skin on my daughter's neck when it got caught between the firm plastic HUGS system and the strap as I adjusted it up.  It wasn't a serious injury but it made her cry and it has made me resent HUGS even more.  The padding around the straps to protect the neck, on the other hand, are great.  They stay in place, are very soft, and my daughter has never complained about being uncomfortable.<br /><br />You do have to remove the straps completely to remove the covers on both seats so there was really no advantage either way in this category.  Since purchasing the seat, I've started using the Summer Infant Deluxe Piddle Pad.  It is easy to remove and clean that pad instead of the whole seat and it was fantastic when we were still potty training.  Even though we haven't had a potty accident in the car in quite some time, we still use the pad in case of occasional food or drink spills.<br /><br />We've had the seat now for about 6 months.  It still looks brand new.  We've actually purchased a second seat just like it for the other car.  The Graco Nautilus went back to the store.",785,Yes,"Harness Type: adjusting the straps; method to adjust the height of the harness shoulder straps; push a button on the back of the seat and pull the headrest up; HUGS system that holds the chest straps in place; padding around the straps to protect the neck

1,4,1,0,3,,"I read and read reviews before purchasing this car seat. I read that people loved it and those that didn't had issues with it that didn't affect me so I decided to save about $100 and ordered this seat. I was excited but the more I've had the seat, the less thrilled I have been with it. Here are my likes/dislikes.<br /><br />Likes:<br />It has a handy dandy cup holder.<br />Has a harness and converts to a booster ""this will be the last seat my son may need!""<br />Did I mention the cup holder? yeah? ok...<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />The latch system.<br />Ignorance is bliss... If you have only ever used this brand perhaps this isn't an issue for you. However- I think every parent should know that there are MUCH MUCH better latching systems out there. These little metal clips are junk and the fact that in order to get the latching systems's belt pulled tightly I have to try to thread it through the seats back and try to pull the strap to the side (the direction of ""out"" of the car) all while kneeling in the seat to ensure its in snug is a pain and usually requires the help of another person. Pretty annoying for a do it yourself-er or someone that travels solo with the kids and doesn't enjoy doing this in an airport parking lot... or at all for that matter. We don't move the seats all that often (some parents transfer seats often- this seat would be a pain if you planned to use latches)but enough to be completely annoying and worry some. I'm a stickler for having my seats in snug with little to NO wobble.<br /><br />Seat Parts-<br />So- kids are dirty. This seat was made to be able to wash the pads/cover Yay (oops that should be a plus) BUT- after removing the seat pads and pieces a foam piece on the headrest that states DO NOT REMOVE fell right off. (its not attached- just sort of hangs there). Ok, no big deal- pop it back on. Well- not a big deal until your child comes by and the piece snaps in half (I swear he barely touched it). My first thought... ok maybe 2nd. First thought was gee I'm pissed. Then- okay- quick- give a call and order a new one! Not open and before and after I tried calling I tried their web page. Followed the directions in entering the model and serial number and its not working. Must be an issue because after the first of many tires there was a pop up to call the 800 number.<br /><br />so- third negative- difficult to get to the parts ordering section of the web page with this seat's model number. (are those Ohs or zeros? hmm neither work! What about a space here, one there? nope, nope nope.<br /><br />the crotch buckle-<br />yup, I read about this in other reviews. I had put my kiddo in the seat in the store and figured- eh, I can adjust it and it will be fine! Wrong-O! They gave approximately 4cm of wiggle room in the belt... perhaps that is one of the ways they save costs on the seat??<br /><br />***This part isn't Graco's fault but if you're a parent and you don't realize this- you need to b/c I've seen/talked to people who don't know better and it freaks me out. Yes- this seat has a harness NO your 9 month old who can sit up or who is 20lb already should NOT use this seat yet! Should STILL BE IN REAR FACING. I've even heard/read people saying something about 6 mo olds. YIKES. NO!<br />And- the ""recline"" handle should read TILT- if your child is both old enough and big enough to use the forward facing seat they do not need to be reclined (adults aren't even supposed to ride reclined in the car) this tilting is to adjust the seat to your car peeps.<br /><br />In reading many many many of the reviews- I read some Britax haters. One commented that people that have Britax just like to throw around the name... First I was like really? Hmm, maybe so. Maybe I too am being a Britax snob. Maybe I don't need to spend the extra money....and Now- I tell them why Britax (or another better brand)... Because the Britax seats FAR surpass the quality and user friendliness of the Graco seats. Those that have used the bucking latch system that has release buttons to remove the seat and ***a strap on EITHER side of the seat to tighten it in***. This is important- because getting your seat in snug and tight is the whole point of a car seat. To keep your babies stable should anything happen.<br />Other brands have the same button release latches that self tighten now!!! YOu just latch, kneel/sit in the seat and push back and no tugging belts! yay!<br />SO- when looking at a seat- study the latch system, the clips across the chest- many of these things are better quality in the pricier seats. Some say- oh you're just paying for better fabric in those seats. Its not just the fabric.<br />You get what you pay for.

It was crucial to us that two adults could sit comfortably in the front seat and one in the back seat with the carseat installed.

4,4,1,1,4,"STURDY, STABLE, SECURE","Two of my three kids recently moved up into booster seats. We were traveling and needed to rent car seats while we were traveling. Being able to take two of these boosters on our trip saved us so much money! My six and four year old also found them comfortable, and they were pliable enough that we were able to put an adult in between them in the back seat. I definitely recommend reading the directions and figuring it out before you need to use it. It's not the most intuitive. We only needed to use the shoulder strap clip on my 4-year-old. It was easiest when he was actually sitting down comfortably, and then I could pull the shoulder strap to where it fit for him. He did complain a little bit that the clip was not very comfortable on the back of his shoulder. Also, what other reviews say about the white clip around the laugh about portion is absolutely true. I found it easier to avoid putting the seat belt through on the buckle side of the seat belt. On the far side, it definitely made sense because it kept the lap belt in a good position. These were great to fold up and put in their backpacks for carry-on forthe airplane. They did add weight to the backpack, But what we saved in space and cost it was worth it. Definitely recommend this product! We have also used it when we have friends come to visit, or pick a friend up to go on a weekend excursion. It saves so much time and transferring boosters!

I chose this over the forever because I’d rather just pay for a booster later than pay $100 more for one to be in the bottom of this seat...just not worth that big of a price jump!

1,4,1,1,0,,"Overall, I think this seat is great and I'd recommend it. There are parts about this seat that I really love and other parts that are frustrating - things that could easily be changed to make this seat awesome!!  This seat is way too innovative and good to make it only an occasional-use / folding / &#34;grab-and-go&#34; seat.  I believe the inventor should re-think the seat and make it a regular-use seat that focuses on ease-of-use instead of the folding & traveling aspects.  What do I mean?<br /><br />1.  Well, we've been using this as our primary seat for our 6-year-old so we leave it permanently &#34;installed.&#34;  The word installed isn't exactly accurate since the seat isn't strapped down & latched the way a baby's car seat would be.  Instead, this seat sits on the regular seat of the car & uses the seatbelt each time - but...  we've been leaving the shoulder-belt strap guide always attached to the belt and the right-side of the lap belt always stays in the right lap-belt guide (the shoulder part of our seatbelt comes over our daughter's right shoulder and the seatbelt buckles next to her left hip). The problem comes when the seat slides back and folds up each time she gets out.  So, everytime she gets back in the car, she needs to reposition the seat and get it to sit flat while the shoulder strap is pulling slightly upward, making the seat fold. Also, as little kids do, she sits down on the edge of the seat and then wiggles herself backward and onto the seat.  This also pushes the seat back and into a semi-folded position that she needs to flatten under herself.<br />What do I suggest?  Make the seat non-folding...  or at least offer a non-folding version... or create a locking mechanism to keep it open & flat.  The folding aspect is cute but only necessary when you need to toss it in a backpack or store it somewhere small.  However, for regular use the whole seat is tiny already, even when it's open / flat.<br /><br />2.  Next issue is something a couple of other reviewers pointed out - the lap-belt guides slide inward way too easily but require you to unlock them with a tab to slide them outwards.  Also, that locking mechanism tab is underneath the seat so that it can't be easily released without standing the child back up.  This seems silly to me - the lap-belt guides get bumped into easily when sliding the lap belt into them and when other kids in the car are shifting around.  I think that the lap-belt guides should be locking in both directions and prefer the locking tab to be accessible (if possible) from the top.  Again, if we're thinking of a regular-use seat that doesn't need to easily fold up for travel, then we can re-imagine the lap-belt guides a tad.  Maybe there's some adjustment that could be made to keep the lap belt in proper position in the right belt guide (in my scenario) so that when she gets back into the seat it won't require a whole repositioning?<br /><br />3.  The shoulder-belt guide strap - as I said above, we always leave this attached. However, when you take off the belt the shoulder-belt strap guide (that red plastic piece) just slides down and needs to be repositioned the next time our daughter gets back in.  What I've been doing is inserting a section of the strap into the guide as a second layer inside the guide along with the shoulder belt.  This keeps the clip of the plastic guide from slipping downward.  However, again, if we re-imagine this seat as a regular-use, non-traveling seat, then maybe we can come up with something better to keep the guide from sliding down or requiring any repositioning each time the child gets back in?<br /><br />Enough about my suggested changes...  What do I really like about this seat?<br />I love that this seat is so compact - not a bulky thing that makes it absolutely impossible to fit 3 boosters or combination of boosters and baby car seats in a row!!!  Our daughter has a small body that didn't require a huge area but all of the other boosters were fixed with wide seats that took up essential room for no reason.  Before this seat, the booster barely squeezed into place and made buckling the seatbelt an absolute misery!  Now, with the mifold, there's so much room, it's a pleasure!  As I said above, the seat is so compact (and adjustable) that we can easily give up some of that in order to make it a regular-use / semi-permanent seat.<br /><br />Also, I love that this adjusts for the child as opposed to the one-size-fits-all boosters that assume all children need to be boosted up a very precise amount.  The adjustable width of the lap-belt guides and adjustable height of the shoulder-belt strap makes this seat great.  Oh, one last thing...  this child seat shouldn't be called a &#34;booster&#34; at all...  it doesn't boost the child up but rather pulls the seatbelt down to position it correctly for the child...  awesome!",865,Yes,"Seat Type: booster

We are definitely pushing the lower limits on height and weight and maybe it works better on bigger kids but it was super unsafe on my 4 year old. The strap in the back would not stay put so most of the time she slid her arm out and let the seat belt go around her waist. Also if your car buckle doesn't already have a lot of backward pull, this isn't great. For it to work it seems like the seat belt already needs to be pulling back against their chest a bit... this device will help lower it to the right height I guess. She sat in the backseat of a minivan and the seat belt did not pull back on her well (it was sort of even with her chest from a side view if that makes sense).

0,3,0,0,5,,"I purchased this seat in Fall 2012 and it now comes with a rear-facing tether strap and instructions on how to use it in the manual. I'm able to get it very secure rear-facing, in the center seat of my Honda Civic, with no pool noodle, and room for 2 passengers. Driver and front passenger seats can still go back because the seat is narrow. I love this seat, the only con for us is that it's not too tall, so my tall son will likely outgrow it in height before he reaches the rear-facing weight limit, but I think he'll still be able to use this rear-facing until at least age 2. Installation is a snap with the seat belt and the seat is very comfortable, apparently. My son falls asleep in here all the time, even on 5-minute car rides :)<br /><br />We purchased an infant car seat when he was born, the Chicco key fit 30, because other parents told me I'd want to be able to remove him from the car in the seat while he was asleep. I guess that was convenient for the first 3-4 months, as sometimes he would continue his nap in the car seat once we got home, or sleep in the car seat in a restaurant, etc. However, the key fit 30 is wide because of the handle, and did not fit nearly as well in my 2007 civic. It was do-able, but the front seats couldn't go back very far, which was an issue for my 6'4"" husband. Plus, the key fit is a small seat - my son has outgrown it in height and he's only 11 months and 22 pounds (he has a huge head, though, so most won't have this problem, LOL). And, once your baby weighs over 15 pounds, you're not going to want to carry them in an infant carrier. I don't care how strong you are, it's just not ergonomic.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a great car seat that's smaller, but still very safe and well-made, consider just getting this one, you'll save yourself money and I don't think infant seats are really worth it. If and when we have another kid, I'll be using this seat from the start.<br /><br />A couple other minor points - the seat is really soft/padded - this is a plus. It has a nice cushion over the crotch strap, which I like for my little dude :) The crotch strap releases by pressing on the top, which I like now, but might be an issue if my son decides he wants to escape some day. We have another seat that requires you to press a button inward to release the straps - this requires you to put a finger behind it to get some leverage, which is awkward. I don't mind the puzzle fit of the strap latch - you get used to it fast. It's really easy to tighten the straps. It's also easy to remove the cover to clean it.",508,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear-facing

My husband and I tried to install it in the backseat of my four door Honda Civic one night after putting our son to bed. We read the directions and used a rolled up towel to try and get the right level on the seats. My car has the latch system, but we just couldn't get the strap to pull tightly enough to keep the seat from wiggling significantly. After almost an hour, we gave up and put his old seat base back in. My husband called one of his friends (with two kids a bit older than ours, so he's an experienced car seat installer) to come over the next night. It took too grown men about half an hour of tugging, pulling and pushing to finally get the seat installed tight enough for us to feel our son would be safe sitting in it.<br /><br />Also, once installed rear facing the seat's tilt can't be adjusted, so make sure you have it set to the recline level you want before installing it rear facing. I wouldn't recommend this for an infant, because I don't think it reclines enough for a baby that can't support it's own head, even with the insert. (Unless you have miraculously flat back seats.) We have it on the most reclined position, but even with a towel the tilt of my rear seats makes it so that it's sitting almost upright.  Once installed, I've had no problems with the seat. It's very easy to adjust the height of the shoulder straps and to tighten and loosen the straps. Also, this seat allows the front passenger seat to go back farther than our previous infant car seat. I'd recommend getting a seat cover, to protect against any puking, accidents, or food spills, because trying to clean the seat itself is a nightmare.

2,3,3,0,3,,"I purchased the updated Britax Boulevard (ClickTight) about a year ago after owning two previous versions of the Britax Boulevard 70 (about 3 years old).  Based on the pictures I see on Amazon, my older version is similar to the Britax Boulevard G4 and not the 'new' ClickTight version which was not available 3 years ago.  In my opinion, this is a case where newer is not better.<br /><br />I believe that this new version has a number of serious flaws as I will describe below, the biggest of which is the ClickTight feature.  If you try to install the seat tightly (which is a fundamental goal when installing a car seat), you will find that, because of the way the ClickTight feature works, it is possible to lock the seat in so tightly that it cannot easily be uninstalled -- while I understand that is in part by design, it is very difficult to predict how loosely you have to install the seat in order for the tightness to be appropriate.  To uninstall the seat, you are forced to turn a small disk using your fingers in a way that you cannot generate sufficent leverage if you install the seat too tightly (which, as I mention, is part of the goal), and I ultimately had to use a vise grip just to uninstall the seat, causing damage to the car seat.  Prior to my involvement in installing the seat, my wife was completely unable to remove the seat as she could not turn the ClickTight disc at all.  I have installed/uninstalled this seat several times, and the difficulty of unlatching and removing the seat has been an issue nearly every time.<br /><br />The seat is also unnecessarily difficult to install, particularly in comparison to our prior Boulevard but also compared to other model car seats that we have used.  If you are used to having easy-on/off LATCH connectors (that's language from the description of the Boulevard G4, which has such easy to use connectors like most other carseats), forget about it here -- the Boulevard ClickTight has metal anchors which are both difficult to install and difficult to remove, forcing you to put pressure on the latch to hold it open while trying to latch blindly to the LATCH tethers.  Depending on your car, this could be a very difficult task.<br /><br />The ClickTight harness only allows certain degrees of snugness, often resulting in the harness feeling too tight or too loose.  I am used to pulling the harness strap tightly enough so that it feels snug but not so tightly that you feel like you're squeezing the air out of your child; with the new ClickTight harness, I find that, depending on how my child is dressed, I am either harnessing too tightly or too loosely, and rarely at the level of snugness and comfort that I can achieve with my other car seats.  I am not confident that the seat is sufficiently snug because there are only certain predefined levels of tightness.<br /><br />Once harnessed in, the release button is buried in a hold between your childs legs.  If you don't have particularly long fingers or are wearing gloves, you will likely find it difficult to conveniently push the button such that it releases the harness.  Keep in mind that you have to apply pressure to the button in the hole while at the same time pulling the straps forward in order to release them; it's not an impossible task, just made more difficult by Britax's design decision to put the button in a hole.  On the plus side, as I've discovered, the hole is a great place to store lost crumbs, cereal, dust, lint, etc. (I'm kidding of course, it's just a terrible design).<br /><br />I can't speak to issues like length of strap or buckle discomfort as mentioned by other reviewers as the child who sits in this seat is not old enough where these are an issue.  Once you get past the ClickTight issue and are able to unlatch the seat, it is just as easy to uninstall as other seats I have used, though it is more difficult to install than any other seat I have used largely due to the type of anchors used.  As it's too late for me to return this seat, I've finally made the decision to put the seat in the dumpster, it's just not worth the frustration -- I would not recommend that anyone buy or use this car seat.",753,Yes,"Installation Type: Clicktight, Latch

It has less padding, it is much thinner and I don't see how it isn't going to pill in the wash.  My kid is going to destroy it.<br /><br />I've included pics of old versus new for reference, but most of it is in the ""feel"".<br /><br />I find this very disappointing, because you want a quality fabric in a ""upper trim"" series car seat that is supposed to last 10 years and costs $300.  It's the same cheap, slick microfiber that I have on a couple of wal-mart $30 booster seats, or on universal car covers.  I imagine it will turn green/gray in the sun just like those did.  My Radian RXT is the same color it was when I bought it and even at two years older, looks better and its been washed a zillion times.<br /><br />At first, I thought they sent me a car seat with the wrong cover, because it says ""Radian R"" and my RXT was embroidered on, not stamped on the fabric like this one.  It also shows on the box as ""Radian RXT"", so I think my confusion is reasonable.  Then I looked at the pictures on their website and Amazon.  Nope.  They are all universally the same crappy fabric across the entire Radian series.<br /><br />Shame on you, Diono, car seats are expensive enough when you have to replace them constantly as you have kids, or have more than one so you aren't dealing with the logistics of switching cars with your spouse or parents just to get kids from point A to point B.  And parents could easily save themselves $100 or $200 by buying something a little less ""premium"".<br /><br />Removing a star for the cheapness, because seeing it there makes me wonder if they are as ""premium and innovative"" as Diono claims.  Companies that do things well would do well to do it across the board, especially if they want repeat business.  I came back because I loved the RTX so much.  Not sure if I needed another one that I would come back for a ""4RTX"" or whatever comes next unless they go back to better covers.<br /><br />For reference, these install amazingly well in Toyota Corolla, Sienna and Highlander and even the tiny Prius, but rear face in a Prius puts the front seat up too far for anyone over 5'6 to sit comfortably (basically every adult in our family).  It will install in a Ford Explorer, but you will still be angry if its leather, cause they really didn't want anyone to get anywhere near their latch to actually use them and they are set too close together, so actually cranking down and getting the seat tight enough is a hassle, but easier than installing a Graco carrier or convertible car seat.  Don't let an entertainment package on a Ford Explorer fool you, not a young family with car seats car. :p",657,Yes,"Material: crappy, thin car seat cover; less padding, much thinner; cheap, slick microfiber; same cheap, slick microfiber that I have on a couple of wal-mart $30 booster seats, or on universal car covers; same crappy fabric across the entire Radian series; better covers

The Latch system is one strap with two buckles that runs through the back of the seat. I purchased this seat after we were in an accident, and this seat replaced a Britax seat. Britax seats come with two individual straps/buckles that attach to a steel bar that then attach to your latch system. This method is infinitely easier to install and get a tight install in minutes, every time. I have never been able to get a tight install with the latch system with this evenflo seat. Yes, you can put pool noodles underneath the seat to get a tighter install as other reviewers have mentioned, but who wants to deal with that? I have gotten a good/tight install with the seatbelt installation though. So take that for what it’s worth.<br /><br />-The harness is hard to adjust. On both of my seats, the harness can get stuck in one position and I’ve had to yank on it so hard that I thought I was going to break it, just to adjust it. This is a no-go if you have multiple kids at different heights using the seat, or if you just need to change the harness height in a hurry. Maybe it’s just my two seats, but both of them are not easy to adjust.<br /><br />-The harness is difficult to tighten. Enough said.<br /><br />-To adjust the headrest height of the seat, there’s a lever you push down on the BACK of the headrest to move the headrest up and down. Not a big deal, right? It’s not, if the seat isn’t already installed. If it is, you can’t do it. You have to take the seat out of the car and adjust the headrest. Again, pain in the A** if you’re in a hurry and trying to adjust it for another kid.<br /><br />-This may not be a con to some, but this seat is huge.

My kids say they’re very comfortable, that’s the only reason I’ve kept them for as long as I have.

There’s definitely enough padding to feel that it’s not going to hurt their little backs on long trips. The cup holders are awesome because they’re removable so it makes messes that much easier to clean up. The only bad thing about this seat is it is pretty difficult to properly install. I have long thin fingers and snaking the seat belt through the tiniest little opening breaks my fingernails every single time I have to move this from one car to the other. And I’m the only one who can install it because no one else can get their arms in there enough to reach it from the other side. And after that it’s nearly impossible to get it stable. This thing definitely slides around no matter how much you tighten it, it seems. So take that into consideration.

I have not had to wash it yet so I will update once I have. My one complaint: it's hard to tighten the harness straps. I found that once I have my little guy strapped in if I first tighten the straps from the back of the seat (we are still rear facing) it becomes much easier to tighten. Grab right above the metal piece that is holding the straps on the back of the seat and then pull down, this pulls most of the slack and you are able to tighten the harness, then make your adjustments to the chest clip and shoulder pads etc. and then a final pull to tighten. This has made the process much easier to get the right fit without feeling like you need to be He-man to do it.<br />I have seen a lot of complaints about the cup holders, they are square in shape and most cups do not fit.

Once our son turned 7 months we decided to move him into a convertible car seat and after much research we decided upon the Advocate 70-CS, we continued to use his Britax infant car seat as our back up car seat. As he began to outgrow the back up, I began my search again. Although, we were very happy with the advocate, it is a huge car seat and I thought it might be a good opportunity to cheat on Britax with the Radian, I was enticed by it's slim design. So I began to research the Radian and went to our local store to see it in person. After weighing the pros and cons, I decided to stay with the Advocate. So what keeps me loyal to the advocate you ask? those side protection air bubbles! As of now my son is in the middle but one day we will have another baby and the new baby will have to go in the middle so I want my son to have all the side protection I can give. Yes, it's huge and some people argue that the air bubbles are overboard but when it involves your child safety you cannot go overboard. Also the installation is AWESOME! I'm one of those crazy moms that would rather bring in the car seat than wake my son from his nap, so ya it's huge and heavy but I can carry it and my 25 lb son through a garage up an elevator to our apartment (if the hubby's around I make him do it) and I probably should not mention this but... it also fits in the Britax B-ready stroller so sometimes if I can't muster the strength, I'll just sit it in the stroller facing me. Britax you might want to bust an Orbit! (they have a convertible car seat that attaches to the stroller). Anyway, we are constantly re-installing our car seat and it's simple and secure every time.

3,5,0,0,3,Fits 3 Across,"Me: father of two, one rear-facing and one front-facing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* It is truly narrow, only slightly wider than a roll of paper towel<br />* The hip flaps cleverly expand to accommodate bigger kids and the seat base folds-up on mechanical hinge for travelling (handy for airport scanners, I suspect).<br />* It’s also built like a tank, the all-steel construction adds peace-of-mind. Even the head side cushions are super sturdy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* This thing weighs a ton. But as heavy as it is, it doesn’t even have any handles, so it feels even heavier. Despite the folding base, I would never take this on a plane on account of how heavy and awkward it is.<br />* Also, despite the fancy folding seats, this seat doesn’t even recline! Instead, it comes with a separate attachment (another thing to carry for travelling…) for rear-facing installation that just sort of props it up on one side, which is kind of like shoving a bunch of books underneath to tilt it. This is truly stupid for a $330 car seat. You can acquire their foam pad to shim the seat to different angles, but this doesn’t seem very tasteful to me and the pads are not even included in the box. I suppose anything could be as small as you want it to be, if it was infinitely disassembled into ""separate"" parts...<br />* Lastly, this seat leans sideways because of its slimness. I tend to position car seats nearer to the doors to widen the middle seat (the whole point of a slim seat is to salvage the middle seat, after all) and, while other wider child seats would just bridge over minor bumps in the car’s seat cushions, this seat’s narrowness makes it lean into those bumps, making it hard straighten. I suppose some shims would be helpful in this case to level the seat.<br /><br />If Diono is reading, here are my recommendations for the future:<br />* Handles or hand-slots for carrying<br />* If you have room for a folding base, you should find room for an articulating reclining mechanism. Otherwise, if both won’t fit, replace the folding base with a recline mech.<br />* If you still must keep the prop-up legs, make it collapsible under the seat instead being a separate attachment.<br />* Consider some kind of a lateral stabilizer like turn-out feet or a tilt-table base.

There is a simple latch in the back of the seat that you pull and the car seat pops out.<br />2) The canopy is excellent and provides a decent amount of coverage.<br />3)  Great safety rating.<br />4)  Our babies were small when we left the hospital and we needed an insert (Summer Infant Snuzzler) to stabilize their head but they did really well with that simple fix.<br />5)  It fits the City Select stroller with a simple adapter.  The adapter snaps into the stroller and then the car seat snaps into the adapter without requiring any complicated or bulky stabilizing bars or straps. The adapters do not have to be removed to collapse the stroller. If you have twins, the only way both car seats will fit the stroller is if they are both facing you. This places the rear baby below the front baby.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) We struggled a bit with the base installation (rear facing) because our back seats are sloped (bucket like).  Even though the marker was within the limits of the level and should have been fine, the car seat was tilted slightly forward causing the babies' heads to flop forward as well. There is a recline adjustment button for the base but it wasn't nearly enough to rectify the tilt. It turns out this is not an infrequent problem and Britax has a youtube video on correcting this. I'm not sure if other car seats have more range in the tilt to accommodate for this problem.<br />2) For installing without the base, the seat belt guides are hidden under the cover so it's a pain to access them to install the seat.<br />3) The cushion coverings can be removed but they're not machine washable.<br />4) The car seats are wide relative to some others so it makes your middle seat virtually useless unless you have a really skinny person.<br />5)  This is a MAJOR con.  Because the car seats are wide, there isn't a single or double snap-n-go on the market that fits the car seats. That means you are committed to your stroller as your only travel system. We like our City Select stroller but the frame is heavy and requires removal of the 2nd seat mounting brackets to fit in the trunk.  For short distances, it's a drag to have to set up the frame.

Several functions on this seat do not work properly and the manual suggests &#34; rigging &#34; the car seat with a towel or pool noodle for proper fit in a car which just doesn't seem safe. It doesn't have a deep fit and leaves your child sitting very up right. When your child falls asleep theres a lot of head bobbing, no support for them to lean their head on in the front facing position. When I received the car seat it had no shoulder strap covers as it was pictured on the one I bought. It came in no plastic covering, just in a box. The fabric stains very easy and the cover is a pain to pull off. When the seat is set to its lowest shoulder position mine would not lock in place and there was a four finger gap between the seat and its sliding adjustable part backing.

It is also moderately wide at the widest parts of the sides, so puzzling with other seats may be a challenge if you are lacking in space.<br />*The harness tends to be very hard to tighten.

We have Graco 4Ever car seats that we use in our vehicles at home, but with five weeks of intense travel this summer (four separate flights, thousands of miles on the road), we needed something much more compact. My main concerns were getting a seat that would be easy to install on a plane, and something compact enough to easily carry through an airport.<br /><br />Generally this seat did the trick. Installing on the plane wasn't always incredibly easy. Airplane seat belts were at times a bit tough to feed through and would rest right underneath my son's bottom. Sometimes I also couldn't get the belt tight enough, but the seat being wedged between his plane seat and the seat in front of him kept it in place.<br /><br />It was very easy to install in our rental cars even without all the bells and whistles that our normal Graco seats at home have. Outside of a bit of the struggle on the plane to install the seat, the only other main complaint is no padding around the neck area. At times it seemed like the straps were digging into my son's neck a bit.<br /><br />But all things considered, the price definitely makes it worth it and you shouldn't expect to get a luxury car seat for this price.

However, I would think this is a good thing unless the child is uncomfortable.)<br />The side impact things move up and down as your child's height adjusts.<br />The pink print is simply beautiful! Very girly yet classy.<br />The seat also comes with tether straps in the back that are supposed to indicate when there has been too much wear and tear to the car seat ( i guess this would also depend on how much your are taking the seat in and out of the car.)<br /><br />I have owned graco and the newer evenflo convertible car seats and they have NOTHING on this seat.

Some people may not like the deeper sides because you have to lift the child over, but it works for us.<br /><br />It must be comfortable, because my son falls right to sleep!

I use a trick I saw online to pull the harness down from the back and then tighten. I also try to avoid loosening the harness when taking him out. Doing this, I've consistently been able to get it properly tight (passes the pinch test).<br /><br />Overall, we really like this seat.

We adjusted the headwings again to their proper height, and over the course of a week under normal driving conditions, the headwings again slipped down and pressed into our son's shoulders.<br /><br />We contacted Diono ""Customer Care"" and sent them a video of our issue.

We were offered a DIY ""remedy kit"" and told that we could try to fix the problem ourselves. Unbelievable. Not only were we told that we had to repair what is clearly a manufacturing defect ourselves, but moreover, they did not currently have this so-called ""remedy kit"" in stock at the moment and that we should use a ""back-up car seat"" while we wait for this DIY ""remedy kit.""<br /><br />We told the Diono Customer Care rep that we did not think it was appropriate to put the responsibility of fixing a manufacturing defect onto the customer who does not have any kind of formal training in car seat repair. This is the kind of thing that should be handled by an experienced Diono technician. We told them that we did not feel comfortable with altering the car seat ourselves and ""hoping"" that we did it correctly. We asked them to either replace our car seat with a new one or pay for the shipping so that we could send it to them for repair. The Customer Care rep said she would have to talk to her ""supervisor's supervisor"" and that she would call us back. She called us back and informed us that since our car seat is out of the one-year warranty window, they would not send us a new car seat, even though the problem we are experiencing is due to a manufacturing defect and/or design flaw and their choice of weak steel.<br /><br />Our car seat is barely two years old. We used it exactly according to the instructions. This company boasts that their seats can last up to 10 years, but will not even fix a manufacturing issue themselves.<br /><br />We look up Diono on the Better Business Bureau and there are similar complaints to ours. This is not a small cosmetic defect but a major flaw of a safety component that is supposed to protect your child's brain side impact in the event of an accident. The fact that they offered a DIY ""remedy kit"" to try ourselves at home to correct this issue in addition to reading about similar complaints from other Diono seat owners leads me to believe that this is not an isolated issue but serious design flaw that the company is trying to pass off onto the customer. They never issued a recall, or sent out any alert to the Radian RXT owners of this flaw. It seems that Diono has known about the flaw enough to produce these so-called ""remedy kits"" but did nothing to alert the owners. Rather, they have stayed silent and in doing so have willfully endangered children who use their car seats.<br /><br />DIONO DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CHILD SAFETY AT ALL. Given the response of the customer care team, it is clear what the company's priorities are. They would rather risk the safety of your child than offer you a properly functioning car seat or even have a technician fix it at their expense. This company only cares about their bottom line, not the actual work of protecting children.<br /><br />DO NOT TRUST DIONO with your child's safety. They have no problem with you using defective car seats and will not alert you of possible malfunctions. When your car seat does malfunction due to their manufacturing/design flaws, they will not send you a replacement or offer any help in fixing it themselves. I will never purchase anything from them ever again and will be alerting other parents of not only their horrible customer service but also their willful neglect of child safety.",758,Yes,"Seat Type: Forward Facing

The fabric seems very easy care and not to &#34;plushy&#34; where it would get too hot in warmer months.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Like other reviewers, I found it extremely difficult to get the harness to fit tight enough to pass the pinch test.  I had the harness height adjusted below my child's shoulders, as instructed for rear-facing installation, and no matter how hard I pulled, I could not get the harness nearly tight enough to pass the pinch test.  It was a hard stop preventing further tightening.  So I figured I must not have the harness height adjusted properly.  I (easily) adjusted the harness height further down, well down below her shoulders.  This helped significantly, and I was able to get the harness much tighter by pulling down on the straps behind the seat while simultaneously pulling HARD on the harness tightening strap.  But it was still not tight enough to pass the pinch test.  Adjusting the harness height even further down below her shoulders would have made the height of the car seat too low for the the top of her head to be adequately protected.  Having to wrestle with the seat to get the harness to just barely approach being tight enough is a both a safety concern and a chore for me.  My child is very long and lean, and perhaps a seat where the seat height and harness height adjust simultaneously just won't fit her well.<br /><br />Also, the lever to release/loosen the harness is located deep inside the seat under the fabric and very difficult to access when installed rear facing.  I can see how this might be an advantage as far as food not collecting in this area.

The tethers are just hooks instead of clicking right in to car tethers they only hook on. No matter how hard you or the strongest man in your life tries, you cannot tighten this car seat to sit safely in the back seat because the belt twists and turns and never tightens properly. It moves at least 3 or 4 inches from side to side no matter how much you try to tighten it. The same issue occurred when you use the seatbelt to install instead of the tethers. In addition, there was no where to store the excess clip belt (that is only used when it is forward facing) when the seat was in rear-facing mode. So the metal clip would just flop around and become a dangerous projectile for the toddler. All in all this thing looks like it is top of the line amazing best car seat ever...

1,5,1,2,3,,"I will agree with another reviewer on this seat.  There is hardly any cushioning in this seat.  It is all harder foam and the cover has hardly any cushioning.  I choose this because I have the Diono Radian RXT(2018 model and a solid seat)which has a little more padding.  My son is 8 and has out grown the 5 point harness of the RXT(he is small for his age).  The RXT does convert to the booster, but I chose to get this booster because it looked to be more specific for the purpose, and cost is not as much of any issue for me when considering my son's safety.  This booster has the larger sidewalls for side impacts.  This is important to me because I will be moving my son from the center seat(unfortunately, because of my truck not having a shoulder belt in the center).  Looking at other brands, I don't feel like the other seats would be that different in regards to comfort or cushioning, and this one seems safer looking to me.  I like the look of the Monterey versus other seats because the sides and the head protection seems to be the largest that I have seen and it is reinforced with aluminum.  It looks like a Nascar seat.  If it's good enough for Nascar, it is good enough for my son.  I will say that I did add about a half inch of ""luxury"" cushioning to every part of this seat to provide more comfort and, I feel, more safety.  I cut and molded them to fit perfectly.  There was plenty of room under the cover to do this and I think it filled it out more.  The cover seemed loose without it.  I am like BASF.  I don't make the products that I buy, but I make them better, ha!  Another reviewer stated that he did not think this was a safe seat, because he said when you pick up the seat from the back part, the bottom falls off.  I will say that they could have designed this better to snap together so that doesn't happen.  The other reviewer also said that he was afraid that the back would come off in impact.  That is not possible, because of the way it goes together, and once you put it in the car and ""latch"" it in, the back cannot come off.  It only comes off when folded backwards to the flat position, which happens when you pick it up from the back.  Again, this could have been designed better for transitioning to another vehicle or just removing and carrying it.  Overall, I think this is as safe of a booster seat as you can get and I like the Diono products versus others in regards to design and safety features.  They could do a little more in regards to comfort and padding for additional safety, so I would not have to modify it.  A little extra padding would not cost that much to add and would definitely make this seat the best on the market, along with a locking mechanism for the back rest to the base. .....just my 3 cents.  I will have to see about the buckling and shoulder strap issues that others have expressed once I have used this more.",550,Yes,"Seat Type: booster

2,7,0,0,3,Washable FabricRemovable Seat Cushion,"Since 2001 I've been hooked on Britax car seats. The quality and ease of use of their seats puts them above their competition. When I was presented with the opportunity to review the Britax Pavilion 70-G3 I jumped at the chance to see how it compared to the Britax Marathon 70-G3.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I pulled this seat out of the box was it's weight.  This seat isn't one that you're going to want to transfer from one car to the next on a regular basis and I certainly wouldn't want to have to lug this seat through an airport.<br /><br />My initial impression of the seat is that it was the overprotective parent's dream come true.  I'm all for a super safe car seat for my child but this seat almost feels like overkill.  The wings that protect the child's head in the event of an accident also keep the child from being able to turn his or her head and look out the window or at a passenger riding next to them.  It also makes loading a child into this seat in the rear facing position a bit difficult.  My nineteen month old who is used to riding in a Marathon 70-G3 and a Roundabout 55 Classic is not thrilled with the seat.  In the past I have not been a fan of the HUGS that are on the harness for the Marathon seats, and I expected the new Safe Cell HUGS to be even more of a pain with regards to loading and unloading my child but they're actually a great improvement on the old HUGS feature.<br /><br />The harness for this seat deserves some attention in this review.  For about five months I put off using and reviewing this seat because I had difficulty loosening the harness when I first took it out of the box.  I've handled a lot of car seats in the eleven and a half years that I've had children and this was the first seat where I had a lot of difficulty loosening the harness enough to get my child in the seat.  I was so irritated by the seat that I put it out and my garage for several months and figured one day when I had more time I'd play with the seat a little more.  When I finally got back to the seat I figured out what I was doing wrong.  I always pull on the harness at the shoulder/chest clip area to loosen the harness (the hang tag instructions for this seat suggest pulling on the chest clip).  Because the HUGS are tethered to the car seat shell doing this means the harness can't be pulled from the top.  I found that if you pull the harness from the lap area the straps loosen with no problem.  So I absolutely understand the frustration that many other parents have had with the harness.<br /><br />Tightening the harness is simple.  Just pull the center strap on the front of the seat and it makes a loud click when the harness is within an acceptable range of tightness.  I think it's a great feature that will help those parents who tend to leave the harness too loose learn how to properly secure their child.<br /><br />Harness height adjustment on this seat is a snap compared to the seats where you need to rethread the harness. You simply have to squeeze and pull (or push) to adjust the height of the harness straps. The ease of use for this function is on par with the simple adjustment of the back on a Graco TurboBooster.<br /><br />Just like the Marathon 70-G3 the versa tether on the Pavillion is energy absorbing and works to reduce forward movement and rotation in a crash. The seat also has the EZ-Buckle System which keeps the harness buckle in a forward position and keeps your child from sitting on the buckle. I can tell you that this feature is quite nice. I had been using a Roundabout 55 Classic with our nineteen month old and I can't tell you how often she ended up sitting on the buckle and freaking out while I try to pull it out from under her. The new design really works nicely to keep the buckle out of the way when loading the baby into the seat. The design reminds me of the harness buckle on our B-Agile stroller.<br /><br />Installation of this seat was a snap. I installed it both rear and forward facing in my Toyota Sienna and it was easily and securely installed in both positions. The seat is on the larger side so it is possible that this seat may not fit well in smaller cars when used in the rear facing position, but I think it's a bit more compact than the Marathon 70-G3 and Roundabout 55 Classic.  Using this seat rear facing I have noticed that my toddler has less leg room with the Pavillion than she has with both the Marathon 70-G3 and the Roundabout 55 Classic.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great quality seat that will keep your little one safe, comfortable and secure for many years. If you can deal with the ease of use difficulties with loosening the harness and your child doesn't mind having his or her view obstructed by the wings around the head then this seat is a very safe option with will offer optimal protection for your child.  In the eleven and a half years that I've been using Britax seats, I have found each of them to be worth the price.  While the Pavillion is a good seat, I prefer the Marathon 70-G3 for ease of use.",954,Yes,"Harness Type

This car seat dolly fit perfectly, and we managed to transfer the seat (with sleeping baby) from the car to the cart no problem at the airport.  It's not obvious from the picture, but the handle part extends to about twice the length shown, and the car seat JUST fits on the bottom section.  There is no room for extra luggage.  Still, at $10/day for a rental carseat that may or may not be complete, safe, or clean, taking along our own trusted seat with this cart made good sense.  We got the Jeep bag for the seat, and gate checked it no problem.  This cart fit in the overhead nicely.  A word of advice though, it's better to go up the aisle with this thing on wheels (put a carry on on it) than carrying it - it kept whacking the seats on each side of the aisle...oopsy!<br />I do wish it had some kind of stabilizer, to keep the angle steady when rolling (more of a stroller frame would have been perfect).  I felt like I was  jerking him around a little, since the handle was slightly too short for me at it's max height.  I'm 5'8"" and I had to walk slightly bent over to keep the ride smooth... and for sure, when stopping, use your foot to keep it from rolling backward and jerking him forward in the seat.

Height of the seat reached under my son’s mid back and the seat bottom was under his mid thigh.  My son could not stand it.  It’s very simple, sleek and stylish but maybe not the most comfortable for my son at least.  Great rigid latch system on the Clek but my son literally asked me to send it back after our test ride in it.  My son liked the Maxi Cosi. The cushion was very comfortable but like the Graco we tried, it restricted his arm movements as the shoulder width was narrow.  The Volvo seat is not worth mentioning. What a piece of crap!  Literally was like taking some hard plastic and covering in a few spots of leather.  You might think that being expensive and a car with great safety specs, they might create an innovative and safe seat. Yeah, about that...Hard, uncomfortable, no latch, useless and over $400 for some piece of garbage. For us, the seats all fell short in one or another area.<br />My 7 year old loves everything about this seat. Easy to use the rigid latch, color is nice, cushion is comfy and easy to clean (fabric zips off) no complaints. He has good arm space and his legs have good seat support underneath. Just happy to have finally found a good, comfortable booster seat without any extra complaints from my gremlin passengers.",318,Yes,"Seat Type: booster

4,4,1,1,0,,"**I want to start this review off saying that I am extremely unimpressed that Graco markets this seat for children as young as three years old. Three year olds and most four year olds do NOT belong in belt positioning boosters as their bones are much too immature to withstand the forces of a crash with the adult seatbelt, and the kids themselves are also not mature enough to stay in position so the belt can do it's job. Car seat manufacturers are just now starting to take the initiative to raise their minimums for their car seats, so it would be wonderful if Graco can do that too.**<br /><br />As for the actual seat itself, this is a good budget seat for children over the age of 5. It is not extremely wide so it can fit in a variety of vehicles, and it provides a great belt fit where the shoulder belt lies firmly in the middle of the shoulder and the lap belt lies flat on the child's hips/top of their thighs. It is very lightweight and easy to move around to other vehicles, and it is also comfortable for kids of all different sizes. The headwings are substantial enough to support the child's head when they are sleeping, and many kids can comfortably rest their heads on the side instead of flopping out of position.<br /><br />Downsides: There is assembly required when you buy this booster, and often times parents throw out or misplace the bag that comes with two little screws which you're supposed to put in the armrests of the booster. This is an extremely important step that will make the seat work correctly in a crash. I think it would be very beneficial for the manufacturer to either have the screws pre-installed, or put a large indication right on the seat itself that the screws need to be in there.",317,Yes,"Seat Type: belt positioning booster

If you have light-colored seats, just a note of warning, with kids things get dirty very quickly, and these seats don't help (I end up cleaning the seats after we take them out, as they get dirty really fast, but I'm sure this is the case for every car seat).<br /><br />The second one we received in 2011... well, let's just start with my main complaint:  locking that sucker in, it's as difficult as installing and reinstalling the seat, or performing brain surgery.  The front button with the red in the middle: it was previously a push down mechanism and it locked well, and if pressed well, then it'll unlock - a system that works seemlessly and was easy on your fingers.  On the newer version, it's not a push down, but you have to press the button (a much smaller button than the old one), which not only breaks your nails, but requires some muscle.<br /><br />The design is different and not quite as good as the old one.  Moreover, you bring the two belts together and clip them, then you insert the little handles into the center red button and let me tell you... on the newer design, that task is nearly impossible.  To lock your child, especially a wiggly one, is a task that takes us at least 10 minutes each time.  It just doesn't lock, and it only does when you're stubborn enough to spend the time and patience to lock it.  The clips and handles and all of that good stuff is at least 40% smaller on the newer model than it was on the older one.  There's a front cover  at the croch area, and in the old one it stays in place, it's thick and comfortable.  On the newer version, it's smaller, thinner, and what's more, it falls off every time - we removed it permanently.  The cover kept covering the locking mechanism making it astronomically harder to lock the belts, than it already is without it.<br /><br />When you want a car seat for a toddler, you need something that locks easily and fast (I'm good with unlocking being difficult).  On the newer seats, unlocking it is easy, but locking your child into the seat is so hard and time consuming it makes me wonder... how many people would give it up.  I know that I'm less open to making stops, so that I won't have to take him in and out of his seat - it's just so painful.<br /><br />The seat itself is great, but if the company would replace those straps and locks for something more functional, it would be a great improvement.  The only reason it actually got the 3 stars instead of 1, is because we still love the first seat we bought, we just hate the newer one.",531,Yes,"Harness Type: locking that sucker in, it's as difficult; The front button with the red in the middle: it was previously a push down mechanism and it locked well; press the button (a much smaller button than the old one); you bring the two belts together and clip them, then you insert the little handles into the center red button; To lock your child, especially a wiggly one, is a task; It just doesn't lock; The clips and handles and all of that good stuff is at least 40% smaller; unlocking it is easy, but locking your child into the seat is so hard; replace those straps and locks

We are traveling out of the country for the first time and will be taking my son's car seat with us through the airports. We were looking for something sturdy and easy to pull the big car seat around. We had purchased another product similar to this and it was AWFUL!!!! It was so flimsy and the seat wouldn't hook securely to it. With this Britax travel cart, the car seat attaches to it using the LATCH tethers. It's such a tight fit that I have no worries about it falling off or tipping. It'd even be sturdy enough to roll my toddler around in it through the airport if we weren't also traveling with his stroller.

After dragging my car seat through several airports while pushing my toddler in the stroller and rolling my suitcase at the same time, I was desperate for a better alternative.  I have seen other similar products that are more like at trolly and cost over $75.  $75 more than I wanted to pay.  When I saw this I was intrigued and loved the price.  Several comments complained about the price for such a simple device, but I had neither the time or inclination to fashion my own.  And for less than $20 I figured it would be worth a try.  It worked perfectly!  I did not put my toddler in the seat only because I didn't need to for this trip.

1,3,3,0,3,,"Britax instructions and customer service is AWFUL! Let me say this--I really like this car seat.<br />PROS:<br />- super-easy to install with seatbelt<br />- the click feature when tightening the straps is really helpful (clicks when straps are appropriately tight around baby)<br />- decent safety rating last time I checked<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Britax communication is horrendous--from their &#34;instructions&#34; to their customer service reps<br />- the clicktight knob that opens the seat (to remove the car seat) won't turn unless you push down on the seat part...but of course, that's not written anywhere letting you know<br />- have to buy cupholder separately (after spending $300-400 on the car seat?!?!?!?!)<br />- the cupholder SUCK, SUCK, SUCKS (very difficult to install and eventually broke trying to re-install it)<br />- The tether and anchor strap compartments constantly pop open<br />- if you try to take this on an airplane, it's very heavy.  But it doesn't work with Britax's wheeled car seat cart made for that exact purpose.<br /><br />If you ever have to get in touch with Britax, brace yourself.  When I called, I got an incredibly unhelpful, unfriendly customer rep named Brenda, who basically informed me that I've been using it improperly ever since we purchased it!  I was calling to ask Britax to explain the bubble diagram on the sides of the seat because, ya know, kinda important to have it installed properly.  I found their description of their recline positions to be somewhat confusing.  The manual says lighter blue is infant, darker blue is toddler.  In another place, it describes the blue for &#34;larger children with head and neck control.&#34;  In the third place, it says it's important that the seat be reclined to maintain proper head and neck control with &#34;smaller infants.&#34;  Then a new guideline popped up when their oh-so-friendly phone rep Brenda tells me the bubble should be in the light blue section if the child is under 2 years.  I asked sweetheart Brenda if that was written anywhere and she said no. I told her that's a pretty crucial piece of information to not have written anywhere (using my best polite words as opposed WTF ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?!?!) and asked her to pass that along as customer input. She said she would but it seemed that she couldn't care less. Awesome.  Since there are NO WORDS on the recline diagram sticker ON the actual car seat describing infant/toddler/age/weight limits, I assumed from the pictures in the bubble area that a younger baby should be reclined further back, but since the standing baby picture is in the darker blue rear-facing and forward-facing, I thought okay, maybe once the baby is 1 year or 20 lbs or maybe standing, you can have it up higher in the dark blue? Apparently, wrong! WTF, Britax?! This is SO important, how could you not have that in writing--like, BOLD writing, too??  It's mind-boggling.<br /><br />Then I asked lovely Brenda about the cup holder (that I'm sure we all love having to buy separately with such an expensive seat). I ordered it on amazon, but again, their &#34;instructions&#34; have no words, save a few &#34;cautions.&#34;  Trying to explain the difficulty verbally without being able to show Britax/Brenda was nearly impossible. You can see from the pictures that the opening on the cupholder clip where you slide the holder down onto the car seat appears to be about half as long as it needs to be, as I see it. She kept telling me to just push/shove it down through the crack/gap where the seatbelt would go, and it would &#34;click&#34; in. It never did, and when I push it down, it pulls the gray plastic section of the car seat away, bending it. That seems like a terrible design if that's how it's supposed to attach, or terrible instructions if it's not. I finally got it clicked in, just to find that when I went to close my car door, it hit the cup holder and wouldn't close.  This doesn't happen with car seats w/ built-in cup holders (as this seat should absolutely have for the price).  So I had to detach it and struggle all over again to put it on the other side of car seat.  The rubber piece on the cup holder would hold cups/bottles so tightly that I finally had to take it off so my kiddo could actually get her cup out.  Of course, to do this, you have to take the cup holder off again.  There isn't a cup/liner within the cupholder that's easily removable, like if drinks spill or the holder gets dirty, so if you ever want to clean it, you have to remove it again.  Then struggle to put it back on.  It's SUCH a pain in the #*@, I can't truly convey it.  I just tried putting it back on yesterday, and after several minutes trying to remember how I'd done it, which I thought was just really jamming it down, as Brenda instructed, it broke.  I'm going to call Britax about replacing it... and hope to get someone who's not Brenda.<br /><br />Another little tidbit they don't tell you is when you push down the cover and it &#34;clicks,&#34; securing the seat, when you want to open it, you can't just turn the dial--I wasted a lot of sweat and cussing struggling with that until I realized you need to push down on the cover, then the dial turns pretty easily. I've read other users who've found the same thing. If this is just how it works, why doesn't Britax TELL US THAT?? Seriously, this company needs a friggin' seminar on COMMUNICATION!<br /><br />Also, as I mentioned above, if you try to take this on an airplane, it's very heavy.  You'll want to buy the Britax wheeled cart to go with it... except wait, don't.  Because even though that cart is made BY BRITAX, FOR THEIR SEATS, these Clicktights don't have the normal, newer anchor strap connections, so you cannot tighten it onto the cart, meaning not only can your kid not sit in it as you wheel it through the airport, but the seat itself slides off at every turn because it can't be tightened on.  My husband and I spent so much time in the airport parking lot trying to figure out how the hell to attach the car seat to the cart that we ended up missing the cutoff for our flight by four minutes.  It was a nightmare.<br /><br />This is the most CAPS-filled review I've ever written. SO ANNOYED with Britax right now. SO annoyed.",1100,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear Facing, Forward Facing

After reading the bad review about the woman who had the horrible experience, I was nervous.  I was traveling alone with my 10-month old for the first time and had the jitters. I had to practice at home first and think the whole scenario through; Going through security was my biggest fear.  Turns out, it wasn't bad at all, and mind you, I was at ATL, the busiest airport in the world.<br /><br />Key points:<br /><br />-I know they tell you to not let your child stay in the seat when you detach the strap...(in a whisper voice) they're just covering themselves.  DO NOT remove your child unless there is someone to hold them.  Mine would have crawled away immediately.  All you have to do is keep one hand on the seat just in case it tips(mine didn't budge, but just in case) while you unhook the strap.<br /><br />-Once I had it tightened to my liking, it took one hand to unhook the top and one side.  Then I just tucked the whole thing, with one side still hooked(there are 3 rings) into my carseat.<br /><br />-In a nutshell, security went like this: Unhooked TT from carseat(4 seconds), took liquids out of carry-on(2 seconds) Unbuckled backpack diaper bag off me (2 seconds).  Then I took my son out of his seat and with one hand, was able to lift all of my items that were lined up next to each other(purse, diaper bag, liquids bag, carry-on bag, and carseat) onto the conveyor belt and in the bins in like 10 seconds.  I even took my out my baby food, while bouncing my little guy in my arm.  Of course it was more of an ordeal than if it was just me, but hey, I had baby.  People and security understood and gave me consideration...well actually, I demanded it, I'll never see them again.  I didn't allow myself to get flustered and it went fine.<br /><br />-After I walked through, I just did everything in reverse.  Took my items off the belt, strapped my little guy in, hooked my carry-on to the seat, and went on my merry way.<br /><br />-It was even easier coming back because I felt seasoned.<br /><br />So in conclusion(LOL)it took a little planning in my head before hand, but worked great!",403,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear Facing

With 4 kids, we have owned 2 infant seats, 2 convertible, and 4 boosters, all from manufacturers.  This Britax Roundabout is, by far, the most sturdy and comfortable.  Here are the characteristics that set it apart from the others:<br /><br />1. Sturdy / immoveable:  We use the LATCH system and once it is in place, it does not move.  No jiggling and wiggling.<br /><br />2. Comfort:  The engineers at Britax really THOUGHT about the comfort of the child and include such things as extra padding in the back, shoulder pads, and a pad for the buckle between the legs, so that his legs don't get pinched or rubbed.  All of these features are added without compromising safety.  The material is soft, not scratchy.",153,Yes,"Seat Type: convertible

I love the it rotates and my son fits comfortably for the most part. The only reason why I didn't do 5 stars is because of the buckle. I wish it came out farther and that the buckles to snap in weren't as wide. I wish there was some cushion on the seatbelt buckle so they don't hurt him.

My 2-year-old is the last of her friends still rear-facing. I thought the extend2fit platform was kinda a gimmick - but it gives my daughter lots of legroom, PLUS a platform to place her toys and loveys on trips, PLUS it makes it easier for me at 5 months pregnant to fit her in the car seat.<br />2. We’ve had a few spills and vomit situations and it’s a breeze to clean. I take off the fabric pieces, throw them in the wash, and hose down the base.<br />3.

The fabric is always cool to the touch when we get back to the car - NOT like her chicco infant seat, which I had to cover with a towel when parked in the sun.<br />5.

I have had the older version for 3 years and my daughter who is now 4 1/2 is still riding comfortably with lots of room and still has 5 or 6 inches of height left and will not reach the weight limit as she is 38 pounds now and 41 inches. I think the height limit is around 48 inches but is an average. If your child is longer torso then they will outgrow quicker and vice versa.

She was still ok and comfortable even though people often commented that she should be forward facing at her age. Research shows to those who don't know that rear facing as long as possible is the most safe.

For starters you need thumbs of steel to turn the lever when the seat is in the car.  In order to get the click tight to click into place you have to kneel in the car seat with your full weight which is not an easy task with so little head room and maneuver space.  It is also difficult to remove the seat so you have to kneel in the seat again to get the click tight to unclick.  This is truly a horrible device.  The leveling of the seat is also a problem.  You have to readjust it several times when you put the seat in the car which is difficult given the soft nature of the back seat.  My daughter called customer service this morning and the representative was not particularly helpful or interested in our problem.

It's not a likely spot for hands to go while in the seat, but it's easy enough to find when out of the seat. I don't think it will cut even an infant's skin, but if for any reason the head rest was adjusted while a hand was in there, I'm sure there would be screaming involved...<br />My only other concern is that the cup holder is not well secured to the seat, it just seems like it would be easy to break off or tip over, but who rates a car by its cup holders?<br /><br />That's it for the negative, now for more positive.

We bought it in May and I was hesitant about it because I realized after opening it that it only used the seatbelt to secure him, not a five point harness. He fit the size parameters though and so we ended up keeping it and using it in my van. Earlier this month (July), we were on a road trip and drove 22 hours to get to our destination.

It doesn't change the angle between lags and back. It is just like one putting a bath towel under the seat. This is my main complaint. As for the headrest, when my daughter sleeps, her head keeps falling down forward, rather than resting on the headrest or the back of the seat.

0,5,0,0,5,,"I really wanted to love this car seat. It looks and feels high quality. I purchased it to go into my Mazda 3. We installed it in the middle seat using the seat belt installation. It took some time to get everything installed and some muscle to get it tight enough.  The fit in the car was tight but doable.<br /><br />The problem with this seat was when I put my son into it his head was pushed forward. He was uncomfortable and I was uncomfortable with the angle of his head. It seemed unsafe. He never fusses in the car but he started fussing and coughing as soon as we put him in and he didn’t stop until we took him out soon after.<br /><br />I’m sure this car seat would work great for older kids and forward facing, but for my 7 month old son- rear facing it didn’t.

I bought it because the buckle strap placement is adjustable and it has solved our problem (the strap on the buckle of our old car seat was too short and made the seat uncomfortable for my son). I like that the seat converts to a booster and is as big as it is. I am definitely happy with the seat - it is much more comfortable for my son. The one (minor) complaint that I have is that the shoulder straps are close enough together that they were irritating my son's neck occasionally - the fix for this is easy though, just velcro some fabric around it and then it doesn't rub. I definitely would recommend this seat.",125,Yes,"Seat Type: converts to a booster

0,2,1,0,5,,"We were gifted this infant seat for our daughter, after researching tons this is the one I registered for. This is my 4th baby, so I’ve used my fair share of car seats and I knew I liked graco & urbini. I decided the graco bc I really wanted the ease of the snuglock, but that is literally the only easy thing about this car seat. I wasn’t very impressed from the time I’d opened it because instead of the soft material everyone else described mine felt scratchy, cushioned enough, but not soft. The strap pads didn’t fit well on my baby at all, thankfully this seat allows for use without those so we tossed them. The one hand adjust is not just a smooth adjustment from positions 1-4, you have to stop at each position and restart from there. In order to adjust the straps you have to press a button that’s usually right under the cover, I’m not one of the people who whines about having the adjust button on the inside, but this one is ridiculous. It’s so far down, and it’s not even with the hole in the cover, so you can barely get your finger in it & since it’s far down you have to thread the strap through on the inside with one finger in the tiny slot because if you don’t it just bunches up at it when you push it through. My baby isn’t comfortable in it either, which is a problem I’ve never had with any of my kids. And the most annoying thing, it sticks in the base. I’m 5’1 & I drive a Toyota Sienna, every single time I try to lift this seat of the base, the front end gets stuck and I have to maneuver it and yank it around to try to get it out all while squeezing the back release handle. Good thing she’s too uncomfortable to sleep in it otherwise I’d be waking her up. My 6’3 husband has less of this issue, so maybe it’s just a height thing, but nevertheless annoying. Material also gets super hot, my babe sweats like crazy in it. Totally wish I would’ve went with urbini or maybe even a simpler model graco.

It is the first seat I have not needed help from my husband to install and that is including before I got pregnant. Our son seems perfectly comfortable in it. Sinching in the LATCH system straps was ridiculously easy and fast and the seat did not budge when I tried to wiggle it around. We normally would not choose to spend so much on a seat if we don't have to. We are always on a tight budget. But we decided to go with this seat because our car is sort of compact. It's a Scion xA. And our son is a tall child at only 2.5 years old. We were not comfortable with forward facing him so soon and this seat has a great height/weight limit for rear facing especially for tall, lean children like my son and it totally fits rear facing in our little car. I needed to be able to safely sit in the front seat in front of it and I can with no problem. I also love how customizable the recline setting is on the seat! It's fabulous. And adjusting the height of the straps at the shoulders is also incredibly easy. This seat is very well made, very user friendly, very safe, and seems to be very comfortable!

I also love the fabric because its very breathable ( super important in florida weather with a baby that sweats when you take him out for 2 seconds). Since my son is so picky about being in the car one thing that was super important for me was to be able to recline the seat to where its not laying down ( only option with a lot of rear facing convertible seats), Im able to recline him to a comfortable position to where he is not trying to pull himself to try to sit.

2,3,0,0,3,,"So far we love the car seat. My daughter has been using it for about a week. This included one long trip to an out of town doctor. She enjoys being able to look around and see out the windows. Everything amazes her since she could see that well from her previous car seat.<br /><br />My daughter is almost two and actually has long legs and she has plenty of leg room now (and we don't even have it set to have has much leg room as this car seat can give of course). In her old carseat she propped her legs up on the back of the seat.<br /><br />The car seat sits very securely rearfacing. It doesn't seem unsturdy at all. I have Dodge Grand Caravan and it's in one of the middle seats. In a smaller vehicle I could see issues with this car seat not fitting, though. It fits snuggly in my van.<br /><br />It can be an issue to get her to sit up straight to fasten her in, though and if she isn't sitting up straight then she has that issue of her chin being tucked into her chest that other people have complained about in reviews. She doesn't seem to mind it but I feel like it is safer for her to be sitting up straight when fastened in.<br /><br />The only negative and the reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because she can't sleep fall asleep easily in it. She DOES fall asleep and is able to sleep okay in it but it takes her a bit to figure out ways to sleep and she has to be extremely sleepy to do it. I do believe that this would be an issue with almost any up right car seat though. She was use to her reclining baby seat. So, this is just different.<br /><br />Oh and it did take my husband a little while to install it but he was able to get it installed securely and without getting annoyed with it. So, it must not have been to bad.<br /><br />My daughter is special needs and has a weak spine and weak muscles. She needs to rear face as long as possible as it will take her longer to get strength in her neck and spine. So, I chose this car seat for its ability to rear face to 50lbs. And for that I do love it.<br /><br />Final consensus is that it's safe and my daughter likes it. So, while I wish she could sleep (and drink her bottle) easier in it overall it's very worth the money and we will likely be purchasing another one of these for our next baby.",457,Yes,"Seat Type: rearfacing, ability to rear face to 50lbs

I did NOT want to be stuck at the rental car agency rummaging through cheap car seats as I have in the past.  So here's what I did...<br />I ordered one cart and EASILY strapped in my Britax Marathon 70.  Since my kids are happy to walk, they would not be riding in it, I took the other childs Marathon 70 and plopped it right onto the other seat. The side straps don't reach the cart but the top belt reaches and all just cinch that real tight and you now have both seats on 1 rack.  It was so good we used it as a cart to pull around our carry on with no tipping or other problems.<br /><br />Security was a breeze. We told the ticket counter we needed to gate check the seats which was fine (AirTran). When we got to security, I motioned right away to the TSA guy these were oversize and he took it through the door. On the way out the one guard asked I separate the seats (1 minute later, done), on the return they said it was fine as is. They took it aside, hand checked it while me and the family walked through.  No problems.<br /><br />At the gate, we went straight to the counter to get tags for the seats, and folded up the cart for overhead carry one - and that was that, next stop was dropping/picking up at end of the walkway.

I absolutely hate the chest clip on Graco models. You have to pinch the plastic with the tip of your thumb and index finger to release the clip, but can't get a good hold. I'm always terrified I'm going to painfully break a nail (and I keep 'em pretty short anyway).

1,4,1,0,3,,"When it comes to my 3 daughters, safety is the most important factor in choosing a car seat for them. For that reason, I own 4 Britax carseats and been very happy with their products. When I needed to shop for a booster seat with 5 point harness for my 2 1/2 year old, I was all set to buy another Britax Frontier SICT. Then I saw how popular the Graco Nautilus 3 in 1 was and what a great rating that Consumer Reports gave them. When I saw that it was literally $100 less, I placed the order. I'm disappoined. At first I was excited by a few of the features, but the practicality or lack there of takes the precedence in my mind.<br /><br />The latch system on this seat is far inferior to the Britax technology. It was much harder to situate the seat properly in my van. And the tighening is only on the right side of the seat and very awkward. I couldn't get a good angle to tighten the seat. I much prefer when the latch on the right and left are independent of each other. It is much easier to tighten them that way.<br /><br />The crotch strap came with a really nice cover, which I thought was great at first to save little legs from being pinched. But, then when it either came off or covered the buckle ever singe time I needed to put my daughter in the carseat, it was annoying, so I took it off. Now, the crotch strap falls through the pad on the bottom of the seat every time I put my daughter in/out. So we have to dig it out from below the pad and feed it back through the hole. ANNOYING! I keep hearing my husband and I saying ""Augh! This carseat!""<br /><br />The straps and buckles feel cheap...especially the chest clip. It is hard to get them to click because they are so flimsy.<br /><br />Finally I've seen my sweet little girl fall asleep a few times now in this seat and everytime, her little head is dangling down because the seat doesn't tilt back far enough to help her head stay in between the rests.
