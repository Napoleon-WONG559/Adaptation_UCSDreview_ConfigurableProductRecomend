I ordered it to fly to grandma's with and have for our visit. My Daughter actually sat in her seat for a week on the couch because she was so excited for her new special seat. The color of the fabric is great and very nice feeling. For the airport I was able to use a big carabiner that I had to hook the handle of the seat to the stroller handle bar(big jogging stroller)--- GREAT way to get through the airport with a wild little and all the stuff.

Some reviewers here were concerned about the buckle being difficult, but I had no issues with it at all.  The box did say &#34;improved buckle&#34; on it so maybe they saw the reviews and fixed it.<br /><br />We had a Graco infant car seat that we just graduated from, and one thing to note is that the adjustment strap on this new car seat is extremely easy to adjust after being used to the infant car seat's adjustment.

1,2,1,0,3,,We've been using this car seat for about two weeks now and my very tall 14-month-old has no complaints. He loves putting his VTEC toys in the cupholder and it looks as if he is able to fall asleep quite easily on longer car rides as long as he has his pacifier and burp cloth next to his cheek. It's easy to installation. I only struggled getting the car seat into the upright back positio once I pulled it out of the box. The material is very breathable and spills on the material are wiped up quite easily. I wish Graco would consider an adaptation to the non-cupholder car seat arm. It would be much easier for someone to get their toddler out of the car seat if the arm would somehow swivel out or pull down. Since my son is so tall I often have to find a tricky way to maneuver him out of the car seat. Lifting him straight up and over the arm often results in his head brushing the roof of the car or very narrowly missing hitting the door frame.

The Sit N Stroll seemed really great, switched easily from car seat to stroller and would have been one less thing to travel with, but the back recline does not adjust and it was too far back for my 2 year old to use as a stroller all day.  I really liked the Traveling Toddler.  It works great.  It's a little annoying that you have to take it apart to go through security etc but it's easy enough to put back together.  I used the largest carry-on I was allowed and it worked beautifully.  My daughter loves her carseat (Britax Marathon) and was loving sitting in and being pushed around.  (Make sure your carry-on pull locks upright or you can't push it in front of you, you'll have to pull it and I found it easier to push.)  I saw someone else with the Go Go thing and it looks great but for nearly triple the price, I got this one since I don't fly often.

2,1,0,0,3,,"My husband and I both purchased the seat for our son. We both like it and so far so does our son. It is roomy, the fabric is soft and the cushioning seems good. The only thing we both are not a fan of, is how difficult it is to get the harness to tighten. We both have the same issues that when pulling the strap to get it right, it is extremely hard to do. I’m small (5’1 / 125lbs) and drive an SUV, I literally have to stand on my runner and pull as hard as I can to get it to adjust/tighten snug enough for him to be safe. Not sure if we’re the only ones, as I read many of the reviews and saw no others with this complaint.

1,2,1,0,3,,"We have been using this car seat for over a year now and it is still in great shape, it has held up well to our two young kids. The quality was great from the beginning and has seen lots of use. It installs/removes easily (relative to other car seats we have tried), it's easy to clean and remove the fabric/padding for washing (my wife's favorite part), it still fits securely in the car and shows no signs of ware (amazingly with the amount of usage it gets, roughly 7-10 driving hours/week and moving between cars periodically). The cup holder and armrests with built in pockets work well for the kids keeping everything within reach. The adjustable seat angle is just right in our Toyota Mini-Van to keep the kids upright yet still comfortable and, of course, safe. The adjustable seat back height allows it to be used for larger kids which was great when or oldest was ready to upgrade to a larger size; we are able to keep using the same seat! We bought this model when our second child was big enough to sit forward, we have the previous model of this seat as well for our younger child (that seat has been in use for about 4 years now) and that seat is also still in great shape! I expect these seat to out last our kids needs, but if we ever had to buy another car seat it would be the Graco Nautilus!<br /><br />The only down side is the padding around the buckle is constantly in the way for the belt latches and I have to constantly pull it down, this was not a problem with the previous model; this is only a minor inconvenience every couple of uses and compared to the everything we like about this seat it's hardly worth mentioning.",309,Yes,"Seat Type: Forward Facing

1,2,1,2,3,,"I will agree with another reviewer on this seat.  There is hardly any cushioning in this seat.  It is all harder foam and the cover has hardly any cushioning.  I choose this because I have the Diono Radian RXT(2018 model and a solid seat)which has a little more padding.  My son is 8 and has out grown the 5 point harness of the RXT(he is small for his age).  The RXT does convert to the booster, but I chose to get this booster because it looked to be more specific for the purpose, and cost is not as much of any issue for me when considering my son's safety.  This booster has the larger sidewalls for side impacts.  This is important to me because I will be moving my son from the center seat(unfortunately, because of my truck not having a shoulder belt in the center).  Looking at other brands, I don't feel like the other seats would be that different in regards to comfort or cushioning, and this one seems safer looking to me.  I like the look of the Monterey versus other seats because the sides and the head protection seems to be the largest that I have seen and it is reinforced with aluminum.  It looks like a Nascar seat.  If it's good enough for Nascar, it is good enough for my son.  I will say that I did add about a half inch of ""luxury"" cushioning to every part of this seat to provide more comfort and, I feel, more safety.  I cut and molded them to fit perfectly.  There was plenty of room under the cover to do this and I think it filled it out more.  The cover seemed loose without it.  I am like BASF.  I don't make the products that I buy, but I make them better, ha!  Another reviewer stated that he did not think this was a safe seat, because he said when you pick up the seat from the back part, the bottom falls off.  I will say that they could have designed this better to snap together so that doesn't happen.  The other reviewer also said that he was afraid that the back would come off in impact.  That is not possible, because of the way it goes together, and once you put it in the car and ""latch"" it in, the back cannot come off.  It only comes off when folded backwards to the flat position, which happens when you pick it up from the back.  Again, this could have been designed better for transitioning to another vehicle or just removing and carrying it.  Overall, I think this is as safe of a booster seat as you can get and I like the Diono products versus others in regards to design and safety features.  They could do a little more in regards to comfort and padding for additional safety, so I would not have to modify it.  A little extra padding would not cost that much to add and would definitely make this seat the best on the market, along with a locking mechanism for the back rest to the base. .....just my 3 cents.  I will have to see about the buckling and shoulder strap issues that others have expressed once I have used this more.",550,Yes,"Seat Type: booster

Sinching in the LATCH system straps was ridiculously easy and fast and the seat did not budge when I tried to wiggle it around. We normally would not choose to spend so much on a seat if we don't have to. We are always on a tight budget. But we decided to go with this seat because our car is sort of compact. It's a Scion xA.

That said, it offers more cushion and side protection than the G4, so I stuck with it.<br /><br />Fast forward to a recent trip with a rental car...I wished that I had the ClickTight functionality with me.  We brought the G4, as it is lighter.  While it was nice not breaking our backs through the airport, I broke my back and more trying to install the dadgum thing in the rental car.  Even the LATCH anchors were a pain to click into the sedan (Toyota Corolla).  Then, I decided to move the seat to the middle and install with a seat belt.

It wasn't the easiest I've ever done, and I made the mistake of expecting to be able to reach in through the belt path. You can't, instead you pull back the cover and reach in that way. But overall, I'd say this is a pretty easy installation. The recline adjustment is awesome. Follow the manual!<br />*It's a nicely compact seat that is also long-lasting, which is a fantastic combination.<br />*I love how organized it is designed and the very clear instructions and stickers on the seat. Chicco did a great job wording the manual and clearly marking the seat. I also love the little compartments for storage on the seat.<br />* Kudos of Chicco for listening to their customers and allowing the strap covers to be optional (go to their website for more information)<br /><br />Cons:<br />*It's a big seat. While it is nicely compact front to back, it is still quite heavy and bulky. Loading a child in and out can be a challenge and it's more of a bucket-shaped seat, which some kids may not like. It is also moderately wide at the widest parts of the sides, so puzzling with other seats may be a challenge if you are lacking in space.<br />*The harness tends to be very hard to tighten.

The pads also get in the way of being able to do the pinch test, and practically choke my son once I finally wrestle the chest clip high enough (have almost hit him in the face several times trying to pull/push the clip up!).<br />*The adjustable headrest can be frustrating to use. It's clunky and takes some finesse to figure out how to press the stiff button and raise the headrest and then find the locked position.<br /><br />Overall, this seat is worth some of the day to day annoyances, and I'm sure with extended use, things loosen up and it becomes easier to do the necessary adjustments.

So many options.<br /><br />Consumer Reports gave this one the highest marks for safety so we went with it. I can now see however why it didn't score highest marks for ease of use. Once you know what you're doing, it's easy enough to install (although I haven't yet tried it in the back of a taxi while the driver taps his foot waiting for me to finish). We put it in the center position of my 2013 Subaru Outback because that's the safest position although it means using the seatbelt rather than the LATCH system. I can't wait until it's standard to have LATCH in all three rear seats of most vehicles.<br /><br />The biggest annoyance with this seat is the strap tightening/loosening mechanisms. They're just poorly thought out and make it a frustrating process to get your kid properly buckled into the seat. I also wish there was a way to hold the straps to the side of the seat so that my toddler doesn't sit in on them every single time he gets in it, and I then have to dig them out from underneath him to buckle.<br /><br />Size wise, it seems to be middle of the range.

Also, the obvious, easy to travel with and move from car to car.<br /><br />Main issues that I read were:<br />- Seat-belt positioner on each side (red ear thingies), locking and folding mechanism: I agree that it is somewhat of an annoyance that you often need to pull the latch on the bottom to readjust their width. They would have been perfect if you also needed to use the latch to retract them, but it is something I learned to accept. Extra 5 seconds is not a big deal in my opinion.<br /><br />- Seat-belt positioner on each side (red ear thingies), inner hook: This is to prevent the belt from sliding out. I admit that it takes some practice to get used to handling these (my wife still cant), but I like that it is this way because the kids also cant play around with it and unbuckle themselves at will. I don't mind this feature at all. You can get used to it. (I just wonder sometimes if rescue people would find it difficult to unlatch in the case of an accident (God forbid), but yet again, they'll probably cut the belts.)<br /><br />- Behind the back belt hook: Can be tricky and a little uncomfortable if they were not at the required level. But once set, they stay and are not a problem.<br /><br />- Sliding off the seat: I only found this issue when trying it with kids that are under the required height.

The fabric seems very easy care and not to &#34;plushy&#34; where it would get too hot in warmer months.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Like other reviewers, I found it extremely difficult to get the harness to fit tight enough to pass the pinch test.  I had the harness height adjusted below my child's shoulders, as instructed for rear-facing installation, and no matter how hard I pulled, I could not get the harness nearly tight enough to pass the pinch test.  It was a hard stop preventing further tightening.  So I figured I must not have the harness height adjusted properly.  I (easily) adjusted the harness height further down, well down below her shoulders.  This helped significantly, and I was able to get the harness much tighter by pulling down on the straps behind the seat while simultaneously pulling HARD on the harness tightening strap.  But it was still not tight enough to pass the pinch test.  Adjusting the harness height even further down below her shoulders would have made the height of the car seat too low for the the top of her head to be adequately protected.  Having to wrestle with the seat to get the harness to just barely approach being tight enough is a both a safety concern and a chore for me.  My child is very long and lean, and perhaps a seat where the seat height and harness height adjust simultaneously just won't fit her well.<br /><br />Also, the lever to release/loosen the harness is located deep inside the seat under the fabric and very difficult to access when installed rear facing.

We live in Atlanta where public transportation is almost never a realistic or safe option and thus everyone has to drive everywhere (especially on the weekends!).  So we knew we needed a quality car seat that could stand up to daily use.<br /><br />In our search, we looked at all of the major brands.  Nothing really impressed us until we found the Combi Connection.  The quality is really unmistakable--a solid handle, amazingly soft Eggshock foam (I don't think the new Connections have the Eggshock foam, which, if true, is a huge misjudgment on Combi's part), EPS foam, a quality pad cover made from expensive cloth, and a fantastic canopy.  The  Connection was also very easy to install using the LATCH system.  The Combi Connection stroller is also great--we use it everyday and have been very happy with it.  Some have criticized the Connection for not having notches to place the seat in the top half of a shopping cart.  This is actually a safety feature--the American Academy of Pediatrics and Consumer Reports both recommend that parents not attach infant car seats to shopping carts in this manner.<br /><br />When I start shopping for my son's convertible car seat, I will again not let price be a consideration (high or low).

Usually infant carrier cerseat is the way to go because you can take it from the vehicle and snap it in the stroller. You can’t do that with this carseat but if you get a stroller that converts into basinet you will not need infant carrier. That way when you take the baby out of this seat you can lay him/her flat in the stroller. Regular strollers don’t recline completely flat and are too spacious for newborn.

But after assembling it and using it for a few weeks, it's not what I expected. I will start with what I disliked. Upon assembling it, I had a hard time connecting the back piece. It does use extra force, but a bit more then I expected. The cloth cover is great quality, but I was not happy with how it was connected to the seat. The directions explained there were 2 top hooks to connect to, and there was not on my seat. I looked everywhere and had my husband check to see if I was missing something and there were no hooks. There was a little nub but the straps wouldn't stay on. I did find 2 hooks tucked in another spot but had to really stretch the cloth and it almost tore. So I made it work, but it's not correct. I could also use a tool to pull the strap through the other side of the car seat to try and keep it on, but it was so difficult and not an easy hook like every other one. It's almost as if the hooks were placed incorrectly on my seat. The seat is also kinda flimsy. When my son leaned over to fasten his seat belt it easily would tip to the side.

Which was really nice! It was easy for my 5 year old to reach the seatbelt and buckle it himself. The seatbelt is pretty tight in there so you have to pull a little harder to buckle up.

1,2,1,2,3,,"I bought this to replace my kid's car seat because despite being so petite, she is old enough now that i thought it would be a little strange(and even a little embarrassing) to keep her in a car seat.  I was also hoping that it would be easier for her to buckle herself in compares to the multi point car seat straps. We were using a safety first air headrest car seat that has a weight rating up to 60 lbs and my daughter is only 36 lbs.<br /><br />I ordered this because i like the idea of the head guard in the event of a side impact collision and the seatbelt over the shoulder guides built in to help keep the seat belt from slipping into a bad/ dangerous position.<br /><br />Upon receiving this booster a few things jumped out at me immediately.<br /> first i noticed how lightweight this booster is.  Lightweight is good, but i was put off by it because the second thing i notice was how flimsy the back of this seat seemed to me.  The construction and design seems like it would break pretty easy if mishandled outside the vehicle.<br />I notice some people didn't like the amount of padding on the seat, but it doesnt seem to be any less padded than the carseats we've owned.<br /><br />A sure-fire plus for me is the narrow width of the seat.  With two safety first car seats int he back of my car, we were barely able to fit 5th passengers in our car between them.  Replacing one of the car-seats with this booster should make that last passenger a lot more comfortable as now there is about 4 or 5 extra inches for them to sit.<br /><br />Most importantly for me though, i am unhappy how my daughter is no longer able to buckle herself.  This is partially a short coming of my vehicle as the buckles are inset into the seat instead of the flopping out kind.  it makes it very difficult (impossible in our situation) for a relatively young kid in a booster to reach under and around to the buckle.  I have to get out of the car buckle my daughter in now when i pick her up in  a busy line of parents getting their kids., which makes all the other parent s behind me in line, have to wait on me.  With a car seat, my daughter had no problem buckling her harness, so now it feels like we have taken a step back in safety and convenience.<br /><br />I think i am going to look into a seat belt extender to held with the buckle situation, and see if that helps.",453,Yes,"Seat Type: booster

1,2,1,0,3,,"We own two of these seats.  One we purchased in December 2010, and the second we purchased on December 2011 (we have two kids, one year apart).  The first one we absolutely loved and still love.  The seat is great, sturdy, easily adjustable, heavy enough, and our son quit screaming in the car ever since he's been facing forward. If you have light-colored seats, just a note of warning, with kids things get dirty very quickly, and these seats don't help (I end up cleaning the seats after we take them out, as they get dirty really fast, but I'm sure this is the case for every car seat).<br /><br />The second one we received in 2011... well, let's just start with my main complaint:  locking that sucker in, it's as difficult as installing and reinstalling the seat, or performing brain surgery.  The front button with the red in the middle: it was previously a push down mechanism and it locked well, and if pressed well, then it'll unlock - a system that works seemlessly and was easy on your fingers.  On the newer version, it's not a push down, but you have to press the button (a much smaller button than the old one), which not only breaks your nails, but requires some muscle.<br /><br />The design is different and not quite as good as the old one.  Moreover, you bring the two belts together and clip them, then you insert the little handles into the center red button and let me tell you... on the newer design, that task is nearly impossible.  To lock your child, especially a wiggly one, is a task that takes us at least 10 minutes each time.  It just doesn't lock, and it only does when you're stubborn enough to spend the time and patience to lock it.  The clips and handles and all of that good stuff is at least 40% smaller on the newer model than it was on the older one.  There's a front cover  at the croch area, and in the old one it stays in place, it's thick and comfortable.  On the newer version, it's smaller, thinner, and what's more, it falls off every time - we removed it permanently.  The cover kept covering the locking mechanism making it astronomically harder to lock the belts, than it already is without it.<br /><br />When you want a car seat for a toddler, you need something that locks easily and fast (I'm good with unlocking being difficult).  On the newer seats, unlocking it is easy, but locking your child into the seat is so hard and time consuming it makes me wonder... how many people would give it up.  I know that I'm less open to making stops, so that I won't have to take him in and out of his seat - it's just so painful.<br /><br />The seat itself is great, but if the company would replace those straps and locks for something more functional, it would be a great improvement.  The only reason it actually got the 3 stars instead of 1, is because we still love the first seat we bought, we just hate the newer one.",531,Yes,"Harness Type: locking that sucker in, it's as difficult; The front button with the red in the middle: it was previously a push down mechanism and it locked well; press the button (a much smaller button than the old one); you bring the two belts together and clip them, then you insert the little handles into the center red button; To lock your child, especially a wiggly one, is a task; It just doesn't lock; The clips and handles and all of that good stuff is at least 40% smaller; unlocking it is easy, but locking your child into the seat is so hard; replace those straps and locks

Since transitioning to this seat we hate going anywhere because our son can not tolerate this carseat.  On top of the crying baby that now cries nonstop, It is very hard to tighten and loosen the straps.  I'm not a wimp but getting any movement when you pull the strap to tighten the baby's shoulder traps is almost impossible. I pretty much only travel with my husband now because I don't feel confident in being able to this seat on my own it is that difficult..  Loosening the straps is just as bad.  Apparently this is the case with the seats with the feature that clicks so you know it is tight enough.  I worry about getting him out quickly in an emergency.  With the other seat it wouldn't have been a problem.  As it stands, after owning this for around a month I still have the same difficulty using it.  It has not gotten any easier.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is we went from having a content 7 month old who was happy in his infant carseat (Chicco kefit 30) and actually enjoyed car rides despite it being too small and cutting into his shoulders at the highest setting, to a 7 month old that cries the entire time he is in the seat unless someone sits in the back and distracts him with food.  I never get to sit in the front when we travel any more and I won't go any place with the baby on my own because the difficulty of use and the crying.  We took the shoulder pads off and that helped some so he isn't crying like he is in pain constantly and we reclined it as far as it goes and that also improved it as far as it goes.  Traveling has been a nightmare with this seat.  We even tried swapping back to the other seat and he was fine for traveling in that, he is just too big for it so it is not safe.<br /><br />I will be saving up to buy a different seat.

0,0,1,0,5,,"We were gifted this infant seat for our daughter, after researching tons this is the one I registered for. This is my 4th baby, so I’ve used my fair share of car seats and I knew I liked graco & urbini. I decided the graco bc I really wanted the ease of the snuglock, but that is literally the only easy thing about this car seat. I wasn’t very impressed from the time I’d opened it because instead of the soft material everyone else described mine felt scratchy, cushioned enough, but not soft. The strap pads didn’t fit well on my baby at all, thankfully this seat allows for use without those so we tossed them. The one hand adjust is not just a smooth adjustment from positions 1-4, you have to stop at each position and restart from there. In order to adjust the straps you have to press a button that’s usually right under the cover, I’m not one of the people who whines about having the adjust button on the inside, but this one is ridiculous. It’s so far down, and it’s not even with the hole in the cover, so you can barely get your finger in it & since it’s far down you have to thread the strap through on the inside with one finger in the tiny slot because if you don’t it just bunches up at it when you push it through. My baby isn’t comfortable in it either, which is a problem I’ve never had with any of my kids. And the most annoying thing, it sticks in the base. I’m 5’1 & I drive a Toyota Sienna, every single time I try to lift this seat of the base, the front end gets stuck and I have to maneuver it and yank it around to try to get it out all while squeezing the back release handle. Good thing she’s too uncomfortable to sleep in it otherwise I’d be waking her up. My 6’3 husband has less of this issue, so maybe it’s just a height thing, but nevertheless annoying.

However, we've now had this car seat for several months and I'm so glad we spent the extra money.  First, the steel bar reinforcement is great - it does make the seat heavier overall, but to me that is a good thing.  The seat sits more securely due to it's extra weight and I don't worry about the car seat possibly getting damaged since it's not completely molded plastic.  Also, the little touches are so nice - the straps do not need to be re-threaded every time my son grows.  It is a minor thing, but as any parent who's had to re-thread a stroller, a car seat, and every other darn thing, you know how nice it is to just not have to bother.  The adjustment of the straps takes literally less than 10 seconds.  The LATCH system attachment buckles are also a breeze.  Usually I let the baby's dad handle switching the seat from car to car, but once we had this one, it was such a breeze to do it myself.  Again, a minor thing, but it makes life so much easier.

After reading the bad review about the woman who had the horrible experience, I was nervous.  I was traveling alone with my 10-month old for the first time and had the jitters. I had to practice at home first and think the whole scenario through; Going through security was my biggest fear.  Turns out, it wasn't bad at all, and mind you, I was at ATL, the busiest airport in the world.<br /><br />Key points:<br /><br />-I know they tell you to not let your child stay in the seat when you detach the strap...(in a whisper voice) they're just covering themselves.  DO NOT remove your child unless there is someone to hold them.  Mine would have crawled away immediately.  All you have to do is keep one hand on the seat just in case it tips(mine didn't budge, but just in case) while you unhook the strap.<br /><br />-Once I had it tightened to my liking, it took one hand to unhook the top and one side.  Then I just tucked the whole thing, with one side still hooked(there are 3 rings) into my carseat.<br /><br />-In a nutshell, security went like this: Unhooked TT from carseat(4 seconds), took liquids out of carry-on(2 seconds) Unbuckled backpack diaper bag off me (2 seconds).  Then I took my son out of his seat and with one hand, was able to lift all of my items that were lined up next to each other(purse, diaper bag, liquids bag, carry-on bag, and carseat) onto the conveyor belt and in the bins in like 10 seconds.  I even took my out my baby food, while bouncing my little guy in my arm.  Of course it was more of an ordeal than if it was just me, but hey, I had baby.  People and security understood and gave me consideration...well actually, I demanded it, I'll never see them again.  I didn't allow myself to get flustered and it went fine.<br /><br />-After I walked through, I just did everything in reverse.  Took my items off the belt, strapped my little guy in, hooked my carry-on to the seat, and went on my merry way.<br /><br />-It was even easier coming back because I felt seasoned.<br /><br />So in conclusion(LOL)it took a little planning in my head before hand, but worked great!",403,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear Facing

I had the original gogobabyz  which I used with my oldest child when he was a toddler but it didn't fit my new larger britax seat, so I bought this britax cart, thinking it would be better because it was made by the company.  On taking it out of the box, it looked like a ""dolly"" you would use to carry boxes.  The latch attachments clip to these rectangular fixtures on the base and it sits a bit high off the ground (several inches).  It felt a little unstable despite the fact that the seat was secured we'll to the cart.  The issue seems to be the center of gravity being higher.  Also when taking my child on a little test run around the house, when we rounded the bend into the kitchen, the latch attachments shifted to the side of the rectangular attachments and the whole seat tipped over.  I figured I needed to install it like in the car, with more pressure. So I decided to tryit on the trip anyway.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I emailed gogo babyz to see if they had a kit to make my old travelmate fit one of my kids marathon car seats.  They did not have a retrofitting kit so they sent me a new travelmate that would fit my larger britax car seat - this is 6 years after I bought the original travelmate!  That is some seriously unusual customer service!  The car seat I installed quickly and felt very secure.  It sits right on the floor and is quite stable.

Aside from all the safety features, my favorite part is the belly buckle is always stuck forward, no more sitting on it.<br />I previously installed her old seat with the seatbelt as the Diplomat (like the Roundabout but with the side wings) didn't have the independent latch hooks for each side of the seat, I wasn't able to get it as tight with latch. This seat was super easy to install with latch. I fiddled with the seatbelt lock off and that looked relatively simple too, you just have to slip your fingers between the front of the seat cover. The cover is able to be taken off without taking the seat out of the car and taking all the straps off- that may make it easier to install with the seatbelt so you can see what you're doing.<br />I also love how long the seats last before expiring, and they hold up very well, her old seat will be passed down to our second child, due in June.

2,1,3,0,3,,"This seat gave us 17 months of infrequent use before the Clicktight (CT) feature rendered the seat unusable. Because we don't have a dedicated vehicle and instead use car-and ride-sharing services, knowing we would be able to safely, correctly, and quickly install a seat with a standard seatbelt in any vehicle, anytime, anywhere was what sold us on the Marathon CT. We were willing to pay more for the CT feature and lug this beast of a seat into Ubers and Zipcars, through airports, and on planes because we believed its quality and supposed ease of use was worth the extra weight and hassle. We still stood behind this seat when its quirks started showing (the harness tension was always slightly uneven no matter how many times we reset it; the harness adjustment area became a repository for crumbs and curious fingers; the selected recline angle was deceiving and would usually decrease once the CT system was engaged; the lower harness straps sometimes left marks on my child's legs; and so on).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the CT system proved to be the demise of this seat. More often than not, the CT dial would only partially engage when I pushed the panel down with my hands, especially when all slack was removed from the seatbelt as instructed. Instead of clicking shut, the panel would bounce off a taut belt. A gentle kneel was almost always needed to fully lock or disengage the CT panel. The seat also was difficult to rear-face in our preferred rear center position in certain vehicles, with multiple attempts needed to ensure a no-budge install.<br /><br />While attempting to install the Marathon CT rear-facing in the rear center position in Toyota sedan last weekend, I encountered my typical issue of the panel not fully engaging when pushed down. I gently kneeled on it to click it shut and the dial became displaced under the panel, making it inoperable. Because we were away from home at a special event, I looked for other ways to install the seat without using CT and found that using LATCH on this seat is (1) absolutely horrendous and (2) impossible to achieve safely without having a functional CT panel, as the LATCH belt path runs under it. We were grateful to make it home safely by doing a makeshift LATCH installation in an outboard seat (kind of like how you attach a seat to the Britax wheeled travel cart, which incidentally ALSO broke the same day - so much for Britax quality!). The LATCH belt was very difficult to loosen and it took 15 minutes for my spouse and I to remove the seat from the car. Worst of all, the seat is no longer safe to use.<br /><br />I have since looked for information in the installation manual as well as on Britax's site about whether kneeling on the CT panel during installation is acceptable and have found nothing discouraging or forbidding it. The seat is no longer under warranty, but I reported the issue to Britax and am awaiting a response. If anything, the CT malfunction has greatly diminished my once-high regard for Britax's safety and durability.

I thought they would save more space vs. the MyFits with the cupholders removed, but the two Dionos free up maybe a centimeter compared to the Chicco seats when side by side.  The rear tethers have clips that are too long, so it's really hard to tighten the tether when the anchor point is right behind the head rest.  Don't even think about traveling with these seats - they weigh a ton.  Also, the shock absorber thing you have to install when your child is forward facing and between 20 and 40 pounds is a bad idea because it's hidden after you put it in.

Also, the instruction manual was vague as to whether to pop out the bottom angle adjuster thing for my child's weight.

But I just can’t.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very nice comfortable fabric, that reminds me of a much more expensive Chicco nextfit.<br /><br />-Easy to clean and pull off fabric cover and throw in the wash.<br /><br />-Super safe if you can get a good install, and made in the USA.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Difficult to install. The Latch system is one strap with two buckles that runs through the back of the seat. I purchased this seat after we were in an accident, and this seat replaced a Britax seat. Britax seats come with two individual straps/buckles that attach to a steel bar that then attach to your latch system. This method is infinitely easier to install and get a tight install in minutes, every time. I have never been able to get a tight install with the latch system with this evenflo seat. Yes, you can put pool noodles underneath the seat to get a tighter install as other reviewers have mentioned, but who wants to deal with that? I have gotten a good/tight install with the seatbelt installation though. So take that for what it’s worth.<br /><br />-The harness is hard to adjust. On both of my seats, the harness can get stuck in one position and I’ve had to yank on it so hard that I thought I was going to break it, just to adjust it. This is a no-go if you have multiple kids at different heights using the seat, or if you just need to change the harness height in a hurry. Maybe it’s just my two seats, but both of them are not easy to adjust.<br /><br />-The harness is difficult to tighten. Enough said.<br /><br />-To adjust the headrest height of the seat, there’s a lever you push down on the BACK of the headrest to move the headrest up and down. Not a big deal, right? It’s not, if the seat isn’t already installed. If it is, you can’t do it. You have to take the seat out of the car and adjust the headrest. Again, pain in the A** if you’re in a hurry and trying to adjust it for another kid.<br /><br />-This may not be a con to some, but this seat is huge. If you need room in your car for additional passengers, I’d suggest the Graco Slimfit.<br /><br />-The base of this seat has no level indicator just a line that should run parallel to the ground. This isn’t a huge deal, but considering the price of this seat, and it’s competitors all do, I was surprised it didn’t come with this option.<br /><br />Overall I’m debating getting rid of both of these seats and replacing them with the Graco 4ever, that’s how much I dislike them.

My husband has a full sized truck and I as the front passenger had to push the seat all the way to the dash and raise the back of the seat to more than 90 degrees for the car seat to fit behind me.

She has never liked any car seat, and still doesn't really enjoy this one, but I do.  The seat is big and comfy and seems much safer with the sides around the head area.  The best feature(s) to me are the adjustable straps.  The shoulder straps slide easily up and down to the correct position and stay that way until I move them, and the knob for adjusting the lap straps are so easy to use.  I can see now that, unfortunately, my oldest child was probably not secured safely in his seat.  I initially wanted a seat that reclined and this was one reason I went with the Triumph Advance.  However, once I read the manual, it seems that the recline position is only to be used with the rear-facing position and my child is too big for that.

I am also glad I got the slim fit since I have an Equinox and there is not much room in the back (we put the seat in the center). However there is a tiny bit more room now than when we had the Chicco pumpkin seat in. (I can sit next to the car seat now without it pressing into my leg/side as before. For reference, I am 200lbs, so not a small person.)<br />Now my favorite parts are that the seat can easily have the height changed. I have a tall baby so that will be great to not have to keep getting taller seats or take a long time to adjust.<br />Also this car seat has been a blessing because baby (4 month old) will ride in this much longer before starting to get upset and even then she just gets a bit fussy. (I have one of those kids that hates the car seat!!) There are two adjustments for the back facing and one allows her to sit up more (which she loves!) as well as being able to kick her feet (and see her feet). We also have enough room to put one of those music kick pianos (strapped down) at her feet so she can have something to do during the drive since she is still learning her hands.<br />I appreciate that the cup holders can slide into itself because it would be uncomfortable for a passenger to ride next to the seat if they didn't since as I mentioned before, not much room as it is.<br /><br />I also like that the side padding next to her head is not touching the side of her head like in the pumpkin seat since that was another thing she didn't like (she would jerk her head side to side trying to get away from it). I still get the safety without her being unhappy.<br />Even though I can't take her in and out in the seat (which not like she liked that anyway), I really am glad I went ahead and got this one. She can get used to it and not have to worry about getting used to a different chair well into her toddler days and even then we would just have to get the booster.

We now have another car seat next to this one and both cup holders are still useable, whereas one of the the flip up cup holders on the Nuna are now blocked by the second car seat. But otherwise, it’s still awkward for him to sit in this seat at almost 3. If I could have gotten two Nuna I would have.<br /><br />Updated 7/29:<br />Now using daily and I am no longer a fan of this car seat. The straps are lopsided - one tightens more than the other, can’t resolve, and I’m sure one loose strap isn’t safe. The straps have to be really low behind his back for his head to be in the “head area”. If straps are at a comfortable, normal spot on his shoulder, the “head area” is above his head. Other reviews mentioned this, but the buckle is so short, it’s hard to buckle the straps and not catch his clothing, legs in it. Argh!<br /><br />Updated 5/29:<br />We have now flown with this car seat on an alaska airlines flight, and installed it in two cars. Used a car seat dolly in the airport and with a 25 lbs kid it was just fine as a “stroller”. The car seat fit just fine on the window seat with the arm rest up between it and my middle seat (I am 5’10” and sat comfortably next to it).<br /><br />Somewhat difficult to install in the cars because we can’t get the seatbelt tight without the car seat being incredibly lopsided. The bottom harness straps are really awkward and wide - instead of going straight to the back, they go wide and cover his legs. Not sure how to explain this any better but it’s really weird, seems uncomfortable, and maybe not safe?<br /><br />Original review: Purchased it because we needed a second one for another car, and to use after he maxes out of his primary seat.<br /><br />Graco may allow for rear-facing longer (I hope - you never know with height, and I’m not sure if or how the leg extension will work). The Graco extends higher than MCM and is easier to install. Graco seat looks more comfortable - it’s flat, whereas the MCM dips down quite a bit. The MCM was slightly “beefier” and I liked that the side impact was also adjustable - but hard to say how child will fit in this car seat later so I liked the backless booster option on the Graco as opposed to possibly having a high-back seat that is very uncomfortable or not useable for older child. They have the same height limit,  but Graco becomes backless booster 100-120lbs, MCM is high back to 120lbs. The cup holders on the MCM were small, I couldn’t fit the Thermos funwhatever bottle. The Graco cup holders pull out quite easily, toddler enjoys doing this...sigh. I don’t think the Graco fabric/color chooses are attractive, but can live.<br /><br />Purchased May 2019. The Graco seat was manufactured in Feb 2019, the MCM in December 2018 (I was worried discounted price = much older seat).<br /><br /> It was hard to choose, as they are similar prices, but other reviews of the seats helped me (Graco rattling noise?

It took me nearly an hour to install this seat in my car (Prius). I purchased a seat cover too but soon discovered that the cover made the car seat slide so I removed it. In order to tighten the seat properly into the car, I had to climb into the seat. This was only possible because I'm petite. I do not know how someone larger than me could get at the right angle to secure the seat. The Extend2Fit feature is nice because my daugher's feet don't kick the seat. However, the trade off is that when fully extended, it pushes the car seat to the edge of the back seat. This in turn means that the front seat has to be pulled forward. I'm short so it wasn't too much of an issue for me. Might be better in a larger SUV or minivan. It is nearly impossible to properly tighten the harness. It tightens around my daughter's legs and is loose on her chest. The buckle strap is incredibly short. If you are used to the ease of use of the Chicco KeyFit 30 harness, you'll be very frustrated with this seat. Also, removing the padding to clean is a big chore. My daughter vomited in the car and I managed to contain it to just one area on the seat. But the process of removing the padding and harness was so difficult, it spread the vomit everywhere.

Since the ProSport was recently recalled, I was informed that because of the recall we could no longer use the latch in booster mode. So I wanted to replace it with a safe booster seat that latched to the vehicle for safety and convenience. Who wants a 30 lb projectile in their car, not me!! I considered the Clek Oobr and Cybex Solution Q-Fix. The Oobr apparently has a short seat pan and is uncomfortable for a lot of kids, especially tall kids like my daughter. The Cybex looks like a great booster. However I was recommended this booster by a CPST and at more than half the price of the other boosters it was a great value. It also becomes a backless booster which the Cybex doesn't do. It is also rated a Best Bet booster by the IIHS. The other great features that only Britax has is the safeguard which keeps the lap belt in the proper position and the safe cell in the base which reduces the forward movement in your child in a collision. At first when I looked at the booster online I had 2 main concerns. Was it upright and flimsy? I can now say no to both of those concerns. This seat is so sturdy and well made. Very solid and substantial. The fabric is very nice looking and great quality, very thick. My daughter loves the pink and it looks great in our van. The bottom part of the booster where the child sits is very well padded and has a thick cushion. The booster back hinges slightly which allows you to get a great angle in your car. I have seen other reviewers think this is a defect but it is designed like that so you can get a great angle for different cars. This seat fits perfect in my Honda Odyssey 2nd row captain's chair. It is so easy to latch in, it takes about 1 minute. My daughter has a perfect seatbelt fit in this booster. The headrest is very easy and smooth to move up and down.

My family is on a very tight budget and when it was time to upgrade from the infant carriers to a forward-facing seat, I had some very specific requirements in mind: price, comfort, ability to grow with child, and safety ratings.  Now obviously there are some great car seats on the market, such as Britax, but these seats also cost twice as much ($200-$300), and I could not afford to spend $400 on car seats.  After much research, including going to a local baby store and comparing the padding, weight, etc., these seemed like the best choice.  Not only are they very reasonable in price, but compared to some of the other brands in the same price range (Safety 1st), this was WAY better!  Not only is the cushioning much thicker, but the seat seems roomy and has plenty of room to grow with my boys.

0,1,0,0,5,,"I purchased this seat in Fall 2012 and it now comes with a rear-facing tether strap and instructions on how to use it in the manual. I'm able to get it very secure rear-facing, in the center seat of my Honda Civic, with no pool noodle, and room for 2 passengers. Driver and front passenger seats can still go back because the seat is narrow. I love this seat, the only con for us is that it's not too tall, so my tall son will likely outgrow it in height before he reaches the rear-facing weight limit, but I think he'll still be able to use this rear-facing until at least age 2. Installation is a snap with the seat belt and the seat is very comfortable, apparently. My son falls asleep in here all the time, even on 5-minute car rides :)<br /><br />We purchased an infant car seat when he was born, the Chicco key fit 30, because other parents told me I'd want to be able to remove him from the car in the seat while he was asleep. I guess that was convenient for the first 3-4 months, as sometimes he would continue his nap in the car seat once we got home, or sleep in the car seat in a restaurant, etc. However, the key fit 30 is wide because of the handle, and did not fit nearly as well in my 2007 civic. It was do-able, but the front seats couldn't go back very far, which was an issue for my 6'4"" husband. Plus, the key fit is a small seat - my son has outgrown it in height and he's only 11 months and 22 pounds (he has a huge head, though, so most won't have this problem, LOL). And, once your baby weighs over 15 pounds, you're not going to want to carry them in an infant carrier. I don't care how strong you are, it's just not ergonomic.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a great car seat that's smaller, but still very safe and well-made, consider just getting this one, you'll save yourself money and I don't think infant seats are really worth it. If and when we have another kid, I'll be using this seat from the start.<br /><br />A couple other minor points - the seat is really soft/padded - this is a plus. It has a nice cushion over the crotch strap, which I like for my little dude :) The crotch strap releases by pressing on the top, which I like now, but might be an issue if my son decides he wants to escape some day. We have another seat that requires you to press a button inward to release the straps - this requires you to put a finger behind it to get some leverage, which is awkward. I don't mind the puzzle fit of the strap latch - you get used to it fast. It's really easy to tighten the straps. It's also easy to remove the cover to clean it.",508,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear-facing

We had been eyeing it for a long time and when we saw it on a lightning deal we finally snagged it up.<br /><br />We were very happy with it at first, before we actually used it. We got our baby in and out of it easily while it was inside our house, but once it was in the car it was a whole other story.<br /><br />(1) This seat is huge. We have a Nissan Rogue, and with the carseat in the second position rear facing it was touching the back of the front seats. It's also very wide. The base is narrow, but it fans out wider at the seat area and it literally made it so I couldn't sit in the back with my baby anymore when we had her in the middle.<br />(2) It is so difficult to tighten the harness! Way, way too difficult. We pride ourselves on proper car seat safety, so I am never willing to compromise when it comes to how tight a harness is or where the chest clip rests. When this seat was not in the car, we didn't have any issues getting it tight enough, but for some reason when it was in the car it was nearly impossible to get it right. I would literally spend 2 or 3 minutes tugging on it, trying to tighten it. Very frustrating.<br />(3) Installation is a joke. I have never had such trouble installing a carseat before. The path for the seat belt is awful -- it took both my husband and me to get it through the path.

We installed and used it exactly according to the instruction manual, and used it in normal city driving conditions. The other week, we noticed that the ""headwings"" that are supposed to protect your child's head from side impact had slid down from their adjusted height and were pressing into our toddler son's shoulders. We had not lowered the headwings at all, but they had slipped to the lowest setting.  We adjusted the headwings again to their proper height, and over the course of a week under normal driving conditions, the headwings again slipped down and pressed into our son's shoulders.<br /><br />We contacted Diono ""Customer Care"" and sent them a video of our issue. We were told that the steel plates in the seat can wear down over time and that is what was causing the headwings to slip down. We were offered a DIY ""remedy kit"" and told that we could try to fix the problem ourselves. Unbelievable. Not only were we told that we had to repair what is clearly a manufacturing defect ourselves, but moreover, they did not currently have this so-called ""remedy kit"" in stock at the moment and that we should use a ""back-up car seat"" while we wait for this DIY ""remedy kit.""<br /><br />We told the Diono Customer Care rep that we did not think it was appropriate to put the responsibility of fixing a manufacturing defect onto the customer who does not have any kind of formal training in car seat repair. This is the kind of thing that should be handled by an experienced Diono technician. We told them that we did not feel comfortable with altering the car seat ourselves and ""hoping"" that we did it correctly. We asked them to either replace our car seat with a new one or pay for the shipping so that we could send it to them for repair. The Customer Care rep said she would have to talk to her ""supervisor's supervisor"" and that she would call us back. She called us back and informed us that since our car seat is out of the one-year warranty window, they would not send us a new car seat, even though the problem we are experiencing is due to a manufacturing defect and/or design flaw and their choice of weak steel.<br /><br />Our car seat is barely two years old. We used it exactly according to the instructions. This company boasts that their seats can last up to 10 years, but will not even fix a manufacturing issue themselves.<br /><br />We look up Diono on the Better Business Bureau and there are similar complaints to ours. This is not a small cosmetic defect but a major flaw of a safety component that is supposed to protect your child's brain side impact in the event of an accident. The fact that they offered a DIY ""remedy kit"" to try ourselves at home to correct this issue in addition to reading about similar complaints from other Diono seat owners leads me to believe that this is not an isolated issue but serious design flaw that the company is trying to pass off onto the customer. They never issued a recall, or sent out any alert to the Radian RXT owners of this flaw. It seems that Diono has known about the flaw enough to produce these so-called ""remedy kits"" but did nothing to alert the owners. Rather, they have stayed silent and in doing so have willfully endangered children who use their car seats.<br /><br />DIONO DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CHILD SAFETY AT ALL. Given the response of the customer care team, it is clear what the company's priorities are. They would rather risk the safety of your child than offer you a properly functioning car seat or even have a technician fix it at their expense. This company only cares about their bottom line, not the actual work of protecting children.<br /><br />DO NOT TRUST DIONO with your child's safety. They have no problem with you using defective car seats and will not alert you of possible malfunctions. When your car seat does malfunction due to their manufacturing/design flaws, they will not send you a replacement or offer any help in fixing it themselves.

My husband was quite skeptical but we both thought it was perfect, especially for traveling. My daughter is 6 but quite slim, and since she just clicked over the 40-lb. weight minimum for boosters, she is still in a convertible booster with a 5-point harness because I believe it's safer and she doesn't complain so why not?  However, we recently took an airplane trip and since we already had to travel with my younger son's carseat, we did not want to lug 2 full sized seats through airports. We decided since driving on our trip would be minimal once we got to our destination, to go with this booster. I'm so glad we did. It inflates and deflates like a breeze. It rolls up and fit in my daughter's backpack until we needed it. It was easy for her to use, comfortable to sit on, and the belt guides were easy to use and kept the seatbelt perfectly placed on her shoulder.<br /><br /> It will be perfect to keep in my car to use when we have an unexpected friend ride along with us because it's small and will fit nicely in the middle seat between our two very large Britax convertible seats, which hard boosters probably would not.

In her old carseat she propped her legs up on the back of the seat.<br /><br />The car seat sits very securely rearfacing. It doesn't seem unsturdy at all. I have Dodge Grand Caravan and it's in one of the middle seats. In a smaller vehicle I could see issues with this car seat not fitting, though. It fits snuggly in my van.<br /><br />It can be an issue to get her to sit up straight to fasten her in, though and if she isn't sitting up straight then she has that issue of her chin being tucked into her chest that other people have complained about in reviews. She doesn't seem to mind it but I feel like it is safer for her to be sitting up straight when fastened in.<br /><br />The only negative and the reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because she can't sleep fall asleep easily in it. She DOES fall asleep and is able to sleep okay in it but it takes her a bit to figure out ways to sleep and she has to be extremely sleepy to do it.

I think you would be hard pressed to find a better car seat in this price category (especially if purchased with an Amazon Prime registry discount). I’ll just say that with our first we used the seat and base that came with our graco stroller travel system, and it was a pain to use. The base did not adjust, so we had to use a pool noodle underneath one side. The straps did not have the front pull to tighten and had to be manually adjusted in the back (for each time we were putting our son in and out of the seat!). The infant insert was useless and we used rolled up blankets around his head instead. The handle required both hands to adjust. We still used it until we upgraded to a convertible seat around 9-10 months, but it was annoying every time. This time around I was determined to get something nicer.<br /><br />This seat is the opposite of all those things and more!

It took me a minute to read the directions to make the proper adjustments and depending on how you secure it (seatbelt or latch/front facing or rear facing) it can be a challenge to secure.  Once it IS secure, the seat is very nice to use.  What I like most is the weight limit and it will be the last car seat that I will have to purchase because it is convertible.  On the other hand, it initially was a pain to clean and I had to watch a You Tube video on how to dismantle it and clean it best.  Once I watched and did it, I had no problems repeating the process.  This seat is as heavy as any other convertible seat, there's no advantage in that regard, but my daughter seems to really like the attached cup holders and side pockets for her toys.<br /><br />The only other thing, is that I found the buckle a little hard to disengage. I have rheumatoid arthritis which has hindered my dexterity, so it has taken me a while to figure out an easy way to disengage the buckle.  Because of the way the seat is designed, I definitely suggest that the seat is checked by someone certified to ensure that the height is correct and that the crotch buckle is in the proper position since it can be modified.

We’ve purchased two of them and there are some amazing pros but also some horrible cons that make me regret ever buying these very expensive car seats, that I am now stuck with FOREVER.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Super easy to install<br />2.  Very easy to adjust as child grows<br /><br />Cons<br />1.  IMPOSSIBLE to actually clean when you have a messy child.<br /><br />Let me explain. My three year old son has had this seat for a year and a half. Trying to take the car seat pad off is an adventure in and of itself. You need a YouTube video just to figure it out. But that’s not even the worst part.<br /><br />There’s no way to clean up a big mess. It seeps down into the actual car seat which you can’t disassemble to clean or fix. My son peed on his by accident. He was asleep and woke himself up by peeing. I cleaned the pad and even sprayed down the seat, because it had pee all down in it. Thank goodness I don’t keep my manual where they suggest or it would have had urine on it as well. The manufacturer suggests that you spot clean or just wash the pad.  But that does nothing if the mess is all the way down into the seat.  They even say you shouldn’t spray down the seat, but I can’t exactly leave pee sloshing around in it now can I.<br />So spray it I did, which then water gets in it. Oh the predicament. But water is better than pee right.<br /><br />Scenario two. My youngest daughter puked on hers. No big deal it’s mostly on the pad and that’s washable. You know what’s not washable, the super high tech straps. First you can’t get them off the seat. So you have to bring the whole seat to the bath, use a bowl of water etc to clean those bad boys. Your supposed to just spot clean those. But that doesn’t really take the puke smell out. So you can incorrectly wash it with some type of chemical and worry that you’ve destroyed the strap or you can live with puke smell. Neither are a good option in my opinion.<br /><br />Now I’ve only had to clean these a few times but each time has made me want to pull my hair out.<br /><br />So mommas save yourself the headache and buy a different seat. Because I don’t know to many kids who aren’t messy and you don’t want to keep their mess FOREVER.<br /><br />Graco please redesign these seats with children in mind. They spill, pee, puke etc all over their seats sometimes multiple times in a week.

She still hates it and fusses alot (9 months later). If she does happen to fall asleep her chin is resting on her chest which never happens in the Britax. Wish we had returned the seat.

1,2,1,1,0,"Super Easy, Car Rental inflatable packable portable luggage travel","Let me start off by saying I have a love/hate relationship with car seats.  I have 5 children, the oldest one is 7, so collectively, I probably have been through 30 car seats in less than a decade.  My daughter has been ready to graduate to a booster seat for 2+ years now, but unfortunately, due to her parents procreation habits, she's been relegated to life in a 5-point harness for lack of space.  It baffles me that mini-van manufacturers don't consider the fact that you may have kids in car seats.  Sure it's great Herb and Ethel sport their Chrysler Town & Country with their teacup poodle Miffy, but we use the heck out of our minivan.  So, when the twins showed up, the three bigs got kicked to the back of the bus and we panicked trying to cram three full seats in the back row.  Thanks to Radian (and $1000), we didn't have to buy a conversion van.  So, after squeezing every moment out of the &#34;baby&#34; seat, I had to find a narrow booster.  Our standard graco booster had birthing hips like my wife, and just didn't squeeze in the back.  Enter, Bubble Bum.  The name and concept are ridiculous, but, by golly, the thing actually works perfect.  I was EXTREMELY skeptical about a blow up seat.  Sure we want our children to live in a bubble, but to actually sit on one?  Low and behold, It fits her narrow booty perfectly and she's now all proud sporting a booster seat.  Granted, there are no frills to this thing.  No cup holder, no secret pockets, no fun stuff, just base model solidness.<br />We've had it probably a month and it's still inflated, and working great.  Thankfully we haven't done any crash testing in it, so I can't validate it's safety.  Hopefully, I'll never have to update my comment about the crash sturdiness.  Paranoia, I looked online and sites claimed it was safety checked and legit.  Now that school is starting back up, kid #1 is begging to be promoted in dad's car as well to a booster.  So, buying a second Bubble Bum.<br />Only negative thing I would say is my daughter complains the seat is &#34;itchy&#34; around the logo.  It is raised, and when she wears skirts or daisy dukes, she complained of scratching.  So, we improvised and she put a wash cloth on the seat.  I'm glad I didn't pay extra for kittens or something pretty on the seat only to have a dirty rag covering it.  Otherwise, works great.  If you're tight on space, it's definitely the seat for you.  I have one in our Odyssey and soon one in an Avalon (adjacent to two Radians).",453,Yes,"Seat Type: booster seat

Even more annoying is the fact that when I pull to tighten the straps, sometimes both of the shoulder straps don't tighten! Often, just one side tightens and then the other just remains loose. I try to pull back slack from the tighter one to get them even, but it is very difficult and doesn't always work.

1,2,1,1,0,,"(Edited on 3/31/2018 to raise the rating from 4 to 5 stars. The lap belt guides do not move in on their own anymore on the newer models!!! A quick recap: this is basically a seatbelt repositioner. A &#34;regular&#34; booster's purpose is to raise the child higher so the seatbelt fits better, and the mifold is a different way of doing it. It may not be the most comfortable seat, but the mifold offers convenience and compactness without sacrificing safety. If the child is too wiggly, this isn't the best product, but then such a child should be in a 5-point harness. Be aware and reasonable about the product's limitations, and you'll be satisfied. You can disregard the below review's portion about the lap belt guides moving in, but I left it in, just so you know there may be different versions.)<br /><br />******************************<br />(Original review)<br />I've been following this product since 2015, participated in the company's crowdfunding and have been eagerly waiting for my mifold to arrive for months. I haven't received that one yet, but imagine my surprise and delight when a mifold showed up in the Vine program, so I quickly grabbed one.<br /><br />This is such a brilliant concept. The purpose of a traditional booster seat is to raise the child up a few inches so the car's seatbelt, designed to fit an adult, can be safely used by a smaller-sized human - the lap belt should not sit at a child's waist. What the mifold does is to bring down the seatbelt to properly restrain a child. Again, brilliant.<br /><br />Part of finding a good booster seat involves how well it fits into your car's rearseat design, like the slope, shape, etc... The best booster seat is the one which fits your car properly. Because the seat portion can bend in half, this allows more flexibility in the type of backseats a booster seat can be placed. The mifold is also great for a larger child who sits too high for a booster seat but sits too low for a car's seatbelt during that in-between stage. It's not as if every child needs to be raised up about 4-5 inches for a proper fit.<br /><br />On the flip side, the mifold may not work as well for shorter children. Since a car's backseat's depth is most likely deeper than the length of a shorter child's upper thighs, the child's legs would be sticking out straight when used properly. Okay, fine, but if the child wants to bend his/her legs at the knees, the child may sit closer to the edge of the backseat, which will make the butt slide farther away from the crease of the back and possibly make the child slouch. Again, depends on the car's backseat and the child.<br /><br />Then, its size... OH, ITS SIZE!!! If you're short on backseat width and have a smaller child who doesn't need the entire width of a traditional booster seat, the mifold will give you those few precious inches for a better 3-across. For the caretakers of 3 kids who feel like their non-minivans/large SUVs won't accommodate multiple child restraint seats but can't afford to buy a larger vehicle, the mifold may save your budget.<br /><br />It's a bit heavier than it looks. The seat bottom is rather firm and small - it's a little over 8&#34; by 8&#34; when unfolded. I was concerned this would be too uncomfortable for the occupant, but it wasn't, possibly because a car's rearseat is very cushioned, allowing the mifold to sink into the cushion. An adult weighing a bit over 100lbs tried it for testing purposes only, and the adult felt fine.<br /><br />The width can be adjusted out to 13.5&#34; internally at the upper thighs, then tapering to a width of 13.25&#34; closer to the knee - the lap belt guides angle in a bit. The red lap belt guides should not be so narrow they touch the occupant.<br /><br />I'd give this 5 stars for ingenuity and practicality, but there are a couple of issues:<br /><br />1. The lap belt guides move in too easily. Pulling them out requires using a couple of tabs, but pushing them in requires virtually no effort. It's very easy to push in the lap belt guides. I think the intent was to make it easier for the child to adjust the lap belt guides' width, but it would've been better to make the child adjust the width to lock in the position before placing it on the car's backseat. If there is some quick, jerky movements while riding, the booster seat may shift. Also, another person sitting next to a mifold user can accidentally push in the lap belt guide. To be fair, I haven't had the lap belt guides get moved yet while in the car, but I can foresee how this may be a problem when things get bumped at a bad time.<br /><br />2. The shoulder belt guide/clip is difficult to open initially. I can open it since I'm an adult who had some practice, but younger kids will need help, along with adults who may not be familiar with the mifold, like the driver for a class field trip. I don't know if the shoulder belt guide mechanism has to lock for the mifold to work properly. Other booster seats have shoulder belt guides that let the user slide in the vehicle's shoulder belt and leave at that, though having it lock does prevent the vehicle's shoulder belt from sliding out.<br /><br />Other quirks that don't affect the star rating:<br />- The shoulder belt guide/clip is made of plastic. It seems durable, and I hope it doesn't break or get loosened after repeated use.<br />- There are lots of sewn-on tags and labels. Since (I assume) these are regulatory requirements, there's nothing mifold can do about them, considering the lack of available space for such items due to the compact size of the mifold.<br />- The manual can be stored in a slot incorporated into the mifold, but it's a little difficult to get the manual in and out - be sure to leave the manual sticking out a bit so it can be removed easier.<br /><br />It's obvious a lot of thought went into designing this. With the mifold, there's no excuse for not using a booster seat, even when traveling. Besides the mechanisms of the guides, I love this product. I hope this gains more popularity so the difficulty and unfamiliarity of using the mifold disappears. Or, maybe the next generation of mifold will improve it. I don't know if this can replace traditional booster seats for some but for traveling and carpools, this is practically a must-have safety item without compromising convenience. In the meantime, I continue to wait for the mifold I ordered via crowdfunding while being grateful for the opportunity to receive one for review - many thanks to Jon Sumroy, the mifold team and Amazon's Vine program.",1168,Yes,"Seat Type: booster seat, traditional booster seat, seatbelt repositioner

He was fine weight wise, but he's such a tall kid his torso height was too much for any other seat.<br /><br />I was told that the Nautilus allowed for a torso height of 21"" so I took a chance and ordered it.  I figured if he was too tall for the five point we'd just put it in booster mode.<br /><br />I was so happy when he tried it out, he's still got just a bit of room to go and might be able to stay in the five point until he's 7yr.

Removing it is a lot easier too.  Our old seats had LATCH belts that were next to impossible to loosen.<br /><br />We have not tried it as a booster yet, so I cant comment on that aspect.  But from the little assembly I had to do, I think they will be great in that function as well.<br /><br />They are wider then I had expected, and we did lose some room in the back seat so if you need to three in the back seat these might cause a problem.<br /><br />Over all I'm VERY please with these seats.

4,2,1,1,4,"STURDY, STABLE, SECURE","Two of my three kids recently moved up into booster seats. We were traveling and needed to rent car seats while we were traveling. Being able to take two of these boosters on our trip saved us so much money! My six and four year old also found them comfortable, and they were pliable enough that we were able to put an adult in between them in the back seat. I definitely recommend reading the directions and figuring it out before you need to use it. It's not the most intuitive. We only needed to use the shoulder strap clip on my 4-year-old. It was easiest when he was actually sitting down comfortably, and then I could pull the shoulder strap to where it fit for him. He did complain a little bit that the clip was not very comfortable on the back of his shoulder. Also, what other reviews say about the white clip around the laugh about portion is absolutely true. I found it easier to avoid putting the seat belt through on the buckle side of the seat belt. On the far side, it definitely made sense because it kept the lap belt in a good position. These were great to fold up and put in their backpacks for carry-on forthe airplane. They did add weight to the backpack, But what we saved in space and cost it was worth it. Definitely recommend this product! We have also used it when we have friends come to visit, or pick a friend up to go on a weekend excursion. It saves so much time and transferring boosters! One last comment and then, I promise I'm done! We have friends that have the cushion travel seat.

The key - and only - selling point for this cart is that it will fit down a narrow airplane aisle. While I have never needed to use it on an airplane, I am certain this claim is factually true. However, one needs to worry more about the child car seat than the actual cart, as the average child car seat is wider than the cart itself...<br />Be advised that the cart uses rollerblade wheels. Anyone who has ever roller bladed *knows* that such wheels are intended for FLAT, SMOOTH surfaces. Airports provide plenty of such surfaces, but it is getting to the airport where this cart is useless. One needs to walk super slow and needs to be ultra careful to avoid every bump, crack, twig, etc to not send the cart and any cargo strapped to it flipping over to its side. In my case, it's only been an empty child car seat that has been sent tumbling over. No one got hurt, but it was an embarrassing inconvenience as you have to stop and readjust and clean everything before resuming your trip at a slow plodding pace.<br />I have since (quickly) replaced this crappy britax with a less expensive luggage cart from PFC.

This makes for a much more stable and reliable transport option, one where I can walk at a much more natural pace.<br />Final note: It is much easier to secure the child car seat to the pfc luggage cart than it is to the britax. This is due to the fact that the pfc is wider and it is easier for the security latches to reach the brackets by the cart's wheels.

Install was fairly easy, I did have to put my weight on the seat and pull to get a secure fit but I had to do the same with the infant seat base.

Its seems trivial but kids love sippy cups and it'd be nice to be able to use the cup holders for all the cups. Evenflo Symphony has the right idea for this. Also, one of the main reasons I switched my 4 month old over early is because the fabric on her infant carrier makes her so sweaty and uncomfortable that she hates being in there, so I was very disappointed to discover the giant warning label printed onto the back of the seat.

I have two Graco slim fit lx (also sold by Walmart under a different name- true fit 3 I think?) that you can just snap off the bottom cover to wash - so easy. Be sure when you wash the diono that the velcro is velcroed because otherwise it will destroy the mesh lining.<br /><br /> What I really like about this Diono is how spacious it is for the kid - they can push down the sides around the thighs and move around, and no giant things around the head, so they can look around. Whereas the gracos really close them in. I also love that it can be folded for storage! And the pink is so cute! The other downside is that the shoulder strap height has to be adjusted manually (have to at least partially uninstall the seat to access the straps) whereas the Graco adjusts the shoulder straps with the click of a button while installed. The slim profile on the diono is visually pleasing and if the kids aren’t in the car I can haul more stuff on top of this seat as opposed to the gracos. I have a civic and they all fit 3 across.<br /><br />I have it forward facing for my older kids as would have to buy the diono angle adjuster to get it to take less room rear facing. So I put the Graco rear facing for my toddler as it takes up less front row room while rear facing.<br /><br />Lastly i like that to uninstall the latch you pull a ribbon loop as opposed to pressing a button.

At 18 months she was as tall and heavy as an average 3 year old boy. She still fits perfectly rear facing in this seat.<br /><br />Now the bad. When you tighten the shoulder straps, it's very hard to pull tight. The straps go over the child's shoulder, and around the back of the seat, where they connect with a metal buckle. This buckle gets hung up on the bottom of the seat. In order to tighten the straps correctlt, I'm forced to reach around the back of the seat, and use my hand to slide this metal buckle over the spot it gets stuck on. It's pretty annoying. I can see other people leaving it looser than necessary because of this design flaw, which could be dangerous.<br /><br />I want to like this seat, but I wish it worked better.

Once the baby insert comes out, it's extremely hard.  Infact, my son has a scar on his lower back, right on the spine from it constantly rubbing the spot where the latch is secured to the seat.  This is THROUGH all the cushioning.  My son has not sat in that car seat for a year and the spot is still visible on his back.  I did not realize what was causing this until I noticed my daughter had a scab in that exact spot.  Quick fix was to add a cloth diaper under the padding for more support.  And it's not just my seat, my nephew has the same spot from his seat as well.<br /><br />* The crotch strap is really close to the back.  This is a huge pain every time my 3 year old gets in the seat.  I have to dig under her to find it.  My son, who is skinny and short for his age, complained a lot about this strap so I eventually moved him to a new booster.  I was attempting to get more use out of this Nautilus by giving it to my daughter.  But the crotch strap is a paint for her as well.<br /><br />* It's not comfortable for long trips, there's no padding, too upright, might be okay for an older child who can sit more upright, but I would NOT recommend this for kids under four.<br /><br />* The release is sometimes difficult to open.  This can be a good thing if you have a houdini child, but when I'm hanging off the back of my driver's seat trying to release her seat belt so she can jump out for school it can be a real pain.<br /><br />On the plus side, I have washed the covers multiple times and it's held up great in the wash.  The cupholder is great (I wish they would put in an insert that could slide out to go in the dishwasher though), as is the hidden toy cubbies.<br /><br />If you do only local driving, this is a great, inexpensive car seat that will last many years.

0,1,3,0,3,,"I was a Britax-only person until I received this. Concept is awesome, but it doesn't work the way it's designed. The idea is to lift the seat cushion of the car seat to full opening, pull the seatbelt across the opening and buckle in, then close the seat. Sounds easy right? It's not. If you pull the seatbelt tight before you close the seat cushion, it will not fully shut because the seatbelt blocks the seat from fitting into place. You have to leave the seat belt loose and then shut the seat. But then when you try to pull it tight, it only tightens one of the layers of the folded belt. The top layer is pulled taut, but the bottom layer remains loose with slack no matter how hard you try. This, to me, is very dangerous.<br /><br />Secondly, the loosening and tightening of the harness straps is very irregular. One will loosen while the other will not, the one that does loosen does not loosen fully, and the straps constantly get uneven where one is loose, but I cannot tighten anymore on my daughter otherwise the other strap will hurt her and be too tight.<br /><br />Lastly, there are rubber guards on the chest connector that always slide down and refuse to remain in place. It becomes a huge hassle when trying to move the chest connector up to its correct position. I'm worried the guards move the chest connector down out of position, too.<br /><br />So not only is the design a poor execution and incredibly difficult and inconvenient to maneuver but it's faults make the seat unsafe.

(I thought they sent me the old ones by mistake.)  So, I installed the new headrests.  One seat performed the same - okay just a little slow to retract.  The other performed much worse than the original, binding up and not retracting when my son leaned forward then back. After almost a month total of back and forth at this point, we had a long driving trip coming up in a few days so I decided to reinstall the original headrest.  It isn't perfect but it did better than what they called their ""fix.""  I am a safety person and I don't love that we have this product with a question surrounding it.  Buyer beware.  I wouldn't buy these boosters again.  Take a look at the difference between where the belt guide is for the Graco products and where they are for the Diono Monteray (tucked behind the headrest wings) and it will explain why the seat belt can't glide freely.  The Monterey would be a great product with the Graco belt guide design.<br /><br />Update:  6/19/12  I sent my two Diono Monterey seats back.  I may never see the $69 in return shipping but I figure my kids are worth more than that.  I ended up losing my last thread of confidence in the boosters after braking hard when a vehicle stopped short in front of me.  I asked my 5 year old son if he was okay and he said, ""My head almost hit the back of your seat, Mommy.""  That was it for me.  I ordered the older version of this seat instead - Sunshine Kids, Monterey, as another reviewer suggested.

3,2,0,0,3,Fits 3 Across,"We bought a Radian RXT in 2018 for our second child and loved it.  It is easily the most secure car seat I have ever strapped my kid into, and we have owned a lot of Graco and installed in several different models and types of car.  Also the easiest install, I've fought for more than 30 minutes in my mom's Ford Explorer with Graco and wanted to set the car on fire afterward for her making me move it over in 105 degree Texas weather.  It is heavy, but I install mine and won't move it for any force in heaven or hell unless I am flying, so its not like I do a daily ruck march with it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Diono is charging the same price they did for once a premium fabric car seat cover and giving you a crappy, thin car seat cover.  Just feeling the difference between the two year models, you can tell they downgraded for the 3RXT severely since putting out the RXT.  It has less padding, it is much thinner and I don't see how it isn't going to pill in the wash.  My kid is going to destroy it.<br /><br />I've included pics of old versus new for reference, but most of it is in the ""feel"".<br /><br />I find this very disappointing, because you want a quality fabric in a ""upper trim"" series car seat that is supposed to last 10 years and costs $300.  It's the same cheap, slick microfiber that I have on a couple of wal-mart $30 booster seats, or on universal car covers.  I imagine it will turn green/gray in the sun just like those did.  My Radian RXT is the same color it was when I bought it and even at two years older, looks better and its been washed a zillion times.<br /><br />At first, I thought they sent me a car seat with the wrong cover, because it says ""Radian R"" and my RXT was embroidered on, not stamped on the fabric like this one.  It also shows on the box as ""Radian RXT"", so I think my confusion is reasonable.  Then I looked at the pictures on their website and Amazon.  Nope.  They are all universally the same crappy fabric across the entire Radian series.<br /><br />Shame on you, Diono, car seats are expensive enough when you have to replace them constantly as you have kids, or have more than one so you aren't dealing with the logistics of switching cars with your spouse or parents just to get kids from point A to point B.  And parents could easily save themselves $100 or $200 by buying something a little less ""premium"".<br /><br />Removing a star for the cheapness, because seeing it there makes me wonder if they are as ""premium and innovative"" as Diono claims.  Companies that do things well would do well to do it across the board, especially if they want repeat business.  I came back because I loved the RTX so much.  Not sure if I needed another one that I would come back for a ""4RTX"" or whatever comes next unless they go back to better covers.<br /><br />For reference, these install amazingly well in Toyota Corolla, Sienna and Highlander and even the tiny Prius, but rear face in a Prius puts the front seat up too far for anyone over 5'6 to sit comfortably (basically every adult in our family).  It will install in a Ford Explorer, but you will still be angry if its leather, cause they really didn't want anyone to get anywhere near their latch to actually use them and they are set too close together, so actually cranking down and getting the seat tight enough is a hassle, but easier than installing a Graco carrier or convertible car seat.  Don't let an entertainment package on a Ford Explorer fool you, not a young family with car seats car. :p",657,Yes,"Material: crappy, thin car seat cover; less padding, much thinner; cheap, slick microfiber; same cheap, slick microfiber that I have on a couple of wal-mart $30 booster seats, or on universal car covers; same crappy fabric across the entire Radian series; better covers

I have a one year old and 4 year old, both very big for their ages (28 and 56 pounds, with height to match) so it was important for me to find car seats with comfort and longevity.  The infinite adjust feature means with one hand I can adjust the seat as they grow without re-threading straps.  I could also adjust to fit the other child just as easily.  Personally I like this color combination of gray and green.  What I couldn't tell from the photos before purchasing is that the gray fabric on the left and right sides is a sort of vinyl material.  This is a positive for me as it will easily wipe down but it's not where they'll be resting against while seated which would be hot.  I LOVE the quick latch connectors and only wish I'd had them on every car seat we've owned over the last 4 years.  While I'm hoping these are the last two car seats I'll ever need to purchase I do recommend them highly to anyone in the market.  I think the only criticism I have is that some of the fabric is a mesh over a base fabric (the green on the Porter for example).

Let me say this--I really like this car seat.<br />PROS:<br />- super-easy to install with seatbelt<br />- the click feature when tightening the straps is really helpful (clicks when straps are appropriately tight around baby)<br />- decent safety rating last time I checked<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Britax communication is horrendous--from their &#34;instructions&#34; to their customer service reps<br />- the clicktight knob that opens the seat (to remove the car seat) won't turn unless you push down on the seat part...but of course, that's not written anywhere letting you know<br />- have to buy cupholder separately (after spending $300-400 on the car seat?!?!?!?!)<br />- the cupholder SUCK, SUCK, SUCKS (very difficult to install and eventually broke trying to re-install it)<br />- The tether and anchor strap compartments constantly pop open<br />- if you try to take this on an airplane, it's very heavy.  But it doesn't work with Britax's wheeled car seat cart made for that exact purpose.<br /><br />If you ever have to get in touch with Britax, brace yourself.  When I called, I got an incredibly unhelpful, unfriendly customer rep named Brenda, who basically informed me that I've been using it improperly ever since we purchased it!  I was calling to ask Britax to explain the bubble diagram on the sides of the seat because, ya know, kinda important to have it installed properly.  I found their description of their recline positions to be somewhat confusing.  The manual says lighter blue is infant, darker blue is toddler.  In another place, it describes the blue for &#34;larger children with head and neck control.&#34;  In the third place, it says it's important that the seat be reclined to maintain proper head and neck control with &#34;smaller infants.&#34;  Then a new guideline popped up when their oh-so-friendly phone rep Brenda tells me the bubble should be in the light blue section if the child is under 2 years.  I asked sweetheart Brenda if that was written anywhere and she said no. I told her that's a pretty crucial piece of information to not have written anywhere (using my best polite words as opposed WTF ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?!?!) and asked her to pass that along as customer input. She said she would but it seemed that she couldn't care less. Awesome.  Since there are NO WORDS on the recline diagram sticker ON the actual car seat describing infant/toddler/age/weight limits, I assumed from the pictures in the bubble area that a younger baby should be reclined further back, but since the standing baby picture is in the darker blue rear-facing and forward-facing, I thought okay, maybe once the baby is 1 year or 20 lbs or maybe standing, you can have it up higher in the dark blue? Apparently, wrong! WTF, Britax?! This is SO important, how could you not have that in writing--like, BOLD writing, too??  It's mind-boggling.<br /><br />Then I asked lovely Brenda about the cup holder (that I'm sure we all love having to buy separately with such an expensive seat). I ordered it on amazon, but again, their &#34;instructions&#34; have no words, save a few &#34;cautions.&#34;  Trying to explain the difficulty verbally without being able to show Britax/Brenda was nearly impossible. You can see from the pictures that the opening on the cupholder clip where you slide the holder down onto the car seat appears to be about half as long as it needs to be, as I see it. She kept telling me to just push/shove it down through the crack/gap where the seatbelt would go, and it would &#34;click&#34; in. It never did, and when I push it down, it pulls the gray plastic section of the car seat away, bending it. That seems like a terrible design if that's how it's supposed to attach, or terrible instructions if it's not. I finally got it clicked in, just to find that when I went to close my car door, it hit the cup holder and wouldn't close.  This doesn't happen with car seats w/ built-in cup holders (as this seat should absolutely have for the price).  So I had to detach it and struggle all over again to put it on the other side of car seat.  The rubber piece on the cup holder would hold cups/bottles so tightly that I finally had to take it off so my kiddo could actually get her cup out.  Of course, to do this, you have to take the cup holder off again.  There isn't a cup/liner within the cupholder that's easily removable, like if drinks spill or the holder gets dirty, so if you ever want to clean it, you have to remove it again.  Then struggle to put it back on.  It's SUCH a pain in the #*@, I can't truly convey it.  I just tried putting it back on yesterday, and after several minutes trying to remember how I'd done it, which I thought was just really jamming it down, as Brenda instructed, it broke.  I'm going to call Britax about replacing it... and hope to get someone who's not Brenda.<br /><br />Another little tidbit they don't tell you is when you push down the cover and it &#34;clicks,&#34; securing the seat, when you want to open it, you can't just turn the dial--I wasted a lot of sweat and cussing struggling with that until I realized you need to push down on the cover, then the dial turns pretty easily. I've read other users who've found the same thing. If this is just how it works, why doesn't Britax TELL US THAT?? Seriously, this company needs a friggin' seminar on COMMUNICATION!<br /><br />Also, as I mentioned above, if you try to take this on an airplane, it's very heavy.  You'll want to buy the Britax wheeled cart to go with it... except wait, don't.  Because even though that cart is made BY BRITAX, FOR THEIR SEATS, these Clicktights don't have the normal, newer anchor strap connections, so you cannot tighten it onto the cart, meaning not only can your kid not sit in it as you wheel it through the airport, but the seat itself slides off at every turn because it can't be tightened on.  My husband and I spent so much time in the airport parking lot trying to figure out how the hell to attach the car seat to the cart that we ended up missing the cutoff for our flight by four minutes.

Once our son turned 7 months we decided to move him into a convertible car seat and after much research we decided upon the Advocate 70-CS, we continued to use his Britax infant car seat as our back up car seat. As he began to outgrow the back up, I began my search again. Although, we were very happy with the advocate, it is a huge car seat and I thought it might be a good opportunity to cheat on Britax with the Radian, I was enticed by it's slim design. So I began to research the Radian and went to our local store to see it in person. After weighing the pros and cons, I decided to stay with the Advocate.

As of now my son is in the middle but one day we will have another baby and the new baby will have to go in the middle so I want my son to have all the side protection I can give.

After 3 different HBBs, this Peg Flex is the holy grail. Here's why:<br /><br />It doesn't have arm rests so your kid can actually do the buckle unassisted. This is huge because you go from a kid that can do their convertible seat straps to a kid that needs to be assisted in finding the buckle every.single.time. in every boosterthat has arm rests. This seat and the Maxi Cosi Rodifix are thus winners in this category.<br /><br />The Flex has a more narrow footprint than others because it doesn't have armrests. Need 3 kids to ride? Need 2 to sit next to one another? You're golden. You can park the Flex next to a variety of seats without issue.

It fits behind the passenger seat with room to spare without the front seat being pushed all the way forward. (We did recline the back of the backseat to help with fit.) We took it to the car seat inspection at the local fire station and they said the install looked great.<br /><br />We like the &#34;headwings&#34; for side impact protection and the somewhat deeper sides of the seat, especially since he's outboard in a smaller car. It makes him seem more protected. It seems like a sturdy seat. Some people may not like the deeper sides because you have to lift the child over, but it works for us.<br /><br />It must be comfortable, because my son falls right to sleep! We did take out the extra head pillow and infant insert because they made him fussy (probably felt too restrictive) and according to the manual, they were not required at his size.

Our last car seat had a removable cup holder that attached to the side, so I love that this one is built into the arm.

The sides allow my son to sleep in the car without his neck being in an awkward position or his head falling forward. The seat does recline with a one handed button on the front, but I believe you are supposed to take it out and adjust the recline then reinstall.

2,2,0,0,3,Washable FabricRemovable Seat Cushion,"Since 2001 I've been hooked on Britax car seats. The quality and ease of use of their seats puts them above their competition. When I was presented with the opportunity to review the Britax Pavilion 70-G3 I jumped at the chance to see how it compared to the Britax Marathon 70-G3.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I pulled this seat out of the box was it's weight.  This seat isn't one that you're going to want to transfer from one car to the next on a regular basis and I certainly wouldn't want to have to lug this seat through an airport.<br /><br />My initial impression of the seat is that it was the overprotective parent's dream come true.  I'm all for a super safe car seat for my child but this seat almost feels like overkill.  The wings that protect the child's head in the event of an accident also keep the child from being able to turn his or her head and look out the window or at a passenger riding next to them.  It also makes loading a child into this seat in the rear facing position a bit difficult.  My nineteen month old who is used to riding in a Marathon 70-G3 and a Roundabout 55 Classic is not thrilled with the seat.  In the past I have not been a fan of the HUGS that are on the harness for the Marathon seats, and I expected the new Safe Cell HUGS to be even more of a pain with regards to loading and unloading my child but they're actually a great improvement on the old HUGS feature.<br /><br />The harness for this seat deserves some attention in this review.  For about five months I put off using and reviewing this seat because I had difficulty loosening the harness when I first took it out of the box.  I've handled a lot of car seats in the eleven and a half years that I've had children and this was the first seat where I had a lot of difficulty loosening the harness enough to get my child in the seat.  I was so irritated by the seat that I put it out and my garage for several months and figured one day when I had more time I'd play with the seat a little more.  When I finally got back to the seat I figured out what I was doing wrong.  I always pull on the harness at the shoulder/chest clip area to loosen the harness (the hang tag instructions for this seat suggest pulling on the chest clip).  Because the HUGS are tethered to the car seat shell doing this means the harness can't be pulled from the top.  I found that if you pull the harness from the lap area the straps loosen with no problem.  So I absolutely understand the frustration that many other parents have had with the harness.<br /><br />Tightening the harness is simple.  Just pull the center strap on the front of the seat and it makes a loud click when the harness is within an acceptable range of tightness.  I think it's a great feature that will help those parents who tend to leave the harness too loose learn how to properly secure their child.<br /><br />Harness height adjustment on this seat is a snap compared to the seats where you need to rethread the harness. You simply have to squeeze and pull (or push) to adjust the height of the harness straps. The ease of use for this function is on par with the simple adjustment of the back on a Graco TurboBooster.<br /><br />Just like the Marathon 70-G3 the versa tether on the Pavillion is energy absorbing and works to reduce forward movement and rotation in a crash. The seat also has the EZ-Buckle System which keeps the harness buckle in a forward position and keeps your child from sitting on the buckle. I can tell you that this feature is quite nice. I had been using a Roundabout 55 Classic with our nineteen month old and I can't tell you how often she ended up sitting on the buckle and freaking out while I try to pull it out from under her. The new design really works nicely to keep the buckle out of the way when loading the baby into the seat. The design reminds me of the harness buckle on our B-Agile stroller.<br /><br />Installation of this seat was a snap. I installed it both rear and forward facing in my Toyota Sienna and it was easily and securely installed in both positions. The seat is on the larger side so it is possible that this seat may not fit well in smaller cars when used in the rear facing position, but I think it's a bit more compact than the Marathon 70-G3 and Roundabout 55 Classic.  Using this seat rear facing I have noticed that my toddler has less leg room with the Pavillion than she has with both the Marathon 70-G3 and the Roundabout 55 Classic.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great quality seat that will keep your little one safe, comfortable and secure for many years. If you can deal with the ease of use difficulties with loosening the harness and your child doesn't mind having his or her view obstructed by the wings around the head then this seat is a very safe option with will offer optimal protection for your child.  In the eleven and a half years that I've been using Britax seats, I have found each of them to be worth the price.  While the Pavillion is a good seat, I prefer the Marathon 70-G3 for ease of use.",954,Yes,"Harness Type

2,2,0,0,1,,"This carseat is terrible. I had a different car seat on my registry and someone purchased me this seat instead, which was the worst decision anyone has ever made.  First off, it's VERY difficult to install.  The latch strap is impossible to tighten and the shape of the sides makes it very difficult to put your weight into the seat to tighten it.  The belt or latch strap threads under the seat, and the seams on the fabric there are so sharp they have actually cut my hand trying to thread the belt.  The positioning of the cupholders on the sides means that the seatbelt install pulls up that side of the carseat making it crooked.<br /><br />Once (if) you manage to get the thing installed correctly, it doesn't get any better.  The pieces at the top used to adjust the back height RATTLE constantly while driving.  It's so aggravating.  We had to keep a towel up there to stop the constant noise.  Not only that, but they're SHARP!  If you ever turn around to pat your kid's hair or hand them something, watch out for those things.  They've left a massive scratch up my arm from getting too close.<br /><br />Finally, the straps on the seat are always getting twisted.  As if it's not difficult enough to get your toddler in and out of the the carseat, the openings in the clips are just large enough that the straps are always twisting around.<br /><br />I would highly recommend against this seat.

We have used, abused and relied upon mountains of, and thousands of dollars worth of different &#34;Kid Gear&#34; throughout the years.  This is my second Britax car seat now.<br /><br />This item is a good one to invest in.  It isn't the cheapest, but as a former police officer, I will tell you, don't cut corners on getting a safe car seat for your child even though they are overpriced.  And make sure it is anchored properly!  No car seat is safe if it is not anchored the right way.  Pull the belt out all the way and crank that dang thing in there tight.  Your kid is worth more than the leather on your back seat.<br /><br />This seat is bulky but rated well for impact.  It has good anchoring options and instructions too.  The only criticism I have besides the cost (I'm sure the mark up on car seats is huge!), is the belt clips under the cushioning are too tight.  If you anchor the seat in tight, there is no way those plastic clips will snap in place.  This could lead a consumer to think those weak clips will hold the seat to the actual seat belt.  Not true; even if they improve those clips.  And on a shoulder belt, those clips are worthless.  Add clearance to the clips and that would be great, or just get rid of them.<br /><br />And by the way, this seat is designed so you don't have to have your wife or another one of this kids with tiny hands to thread the belt through the seat.

In fact, I had to uninstall it once because the harness wasn't quite right, and re-install it (without help!). And it took me less than five minutes both times. The seat is solid! It hardly moves half an inch when I try to shake it. The seat belt barely made it to the latch, that's true. But, once clipped, that seat wasn't going anywhere.

Simply slide the strap loop end off the hook, pull through the back of the seat, stick it through the shoulder heighth you want, and then slide it back on the hook thing.  No complicated re-threading, and yet it's still a very secure connection.  Also very easy to tighten and loosen.  In fact, everytime I put my child in the carseat, I loosen the shoulder straps, buckle him in, and then tighten the straps around his shoulders.  It only takes a second, and I'm sure of a secure fit every single time.<br /><br />Comfort: This seat sits high.  If your car has low ceilings, maybe that would be a nuisance getting him in, but I'm putting my kiddo in the back of an extended cab 4door pickup which is very roomy.  The seat sitting so high off the bench makes it very easy for my son to see out the window.  He likes that.  The padding is comfortable and the seat is wide.  My toddler is average height & weight (50th percentile).  The seat also is angled back a little more than the Safety 1st one we had.  So if my son falls asleep, he is a little more comfortable.<br /><br />Safety:  This carseat feels sturdy.  The wings on either side of my toddlers head give me piece of mind about side impact.  The child sits more deeply in this seat than our old one, so I feel like he's better protected.<br /><br />Practicalilty:  This seat is easy to wipe down with a damp cloth.  The fabric doesn't hold crumbs.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Size:  This seat is huge.  It DOES fit in my Nissan Sentra, but it's huge.  I have 2 of these in the back of my nissan and you cannot use the 3rd seatbelt.  You also cannot put them right next to each other in the  Nissan, however you CAN put them next to each other in roomy cab of the pickup and I've put them next to each other in the back of a Suburban and they fit.

When it came time to get the second car seat, we purchased this 70-G3 for my car, only because the 2012s were no longer available at as good a price. This one is in my 2-door sports coupe and it still fits rear-facing and in the center seat. I worried it might not fit there, or that it might be hard to see over when looking in the rearview mirror, but all was for naught. It fits great, and it doesn't obstruct my view at all.<br /><br />Between the two versions we have, the main difference that I've noticed is that this 70-G3's straps don't lengthen as much as the older version, meaning we have to work a little harder to get our daughter's arms through when buckling her in. This appears to be a safety feature (&#34;Versa&#34; Tether related). Otherwise, it's a great seat so far. She sweats quite a bit in it sometimes (living in AZ), but car seats are not breathable anyway, so I imagine this would happen in any car seat, especially when rear-facing.

Additionally, it takes up almost no space in your luggage. On that basis alone, it's worth 5 stars.<br /><br />As a daily carseat, I think it isn't as strong of a use case. It can be difficult to get set up if you're constantly moving it because of the mechanism that is used to pull the shoulder belt down to a child's height.

I would describe this as an OK budget option, but if you can, spring for a better quality car seat. This is the thing that will protect your child in the event of a collision, so if you can save up for a better seat, please do.<br /><br />Our 11-month-old was very unhappy getting fitted in this, he hated the position, and as others have pointed out it will be hard for him to sleep in here comfortably (which is also dangerous if his head is not positioned properly).<br /><br />As others pointed out, this thing feels flimsy. There are exposed parts in the back that rattle around a lot, regardless of whether there's a kid in it. It's mostly the parts that interface to raise and lower the back, so you might be able to wrap some electrical tape around the metal pieces to dampen the sound, but that seems like a silly solution to a sub-par design.<br /><br />The LATCH straps. Where to start? Why did they even bother? Chicco has a latch strap with nice plastic-coated attachment points that resemble a seatbelt clipping in. This thing just has metal hooks on the end with a flimsy little retainer piece. Then you have to awkwardly try to pull it like a seatbelt to get it tight enough. All of my body weight and all of my strength trying to tighten the strap was futile, because ultimately you're pulling a strap perpendicular to the direction that you need to tighten it.<br /><br />I tightened this as much as I could and still had a good 6"" of play on the front of the seat -- way more than is safe. It would have been far better to drop the LATCH system entirely and require the much more complicated (read: likely to be done incorrectly) seat belt installation.<br /><br />Back in the box this went.

It also takes up quite a bit more room in the car than I imagined - again, I'm sure this is not an issue limited to this particular seat, but to the entire rear-facing car seat universe. Outside of that, I can't complain too much. It is a bit tricky to get the seatbelt harness to unlatch once the lil one is strapped in. It feels like I have to push way too hard on the button to get it to release, and means that I am putting pressure on her when I do so - even with a hand (or a few fingers rather) between the buckle and my baby. I'm working on technique to help get around that issue.<br /><br />The ease of snapping it in and out of the base is unbelievable though. So easy. ONce you get the base secured that is. That may take a little bit of trail and error depending on your vehicle and whether or not you plan to use a seat cover to protect your car seat's surface from the bottom of the base (which we did on my wife's car, but not on mine). Still, pretty easy to get that taken care of, just means you need to check it from time to time to make sure it has't compressed the car seat cover enough to make the base a tad bit loose (has never gone from green to red - but has show a red line from time to time on the &#34;tightness indicator&#34;).<br /><br />Installing this in my car, however, was a nightmare. MY fault for driving a Mustang. To all you out there with a car that has little to no back seat room, rest assured the seat will fit - although very very tight - and to be honest, probably not meeting ALL of the manufacturer's suggested space between baby seat and back of front seat requirements if you are trying to have an adult riding shotgun comfortably. But installing the base will be a major pain in the a double-s because you have virtually no room to maneuver yourself on top of the damn thing to make sure it is secured tightly (ie - to make that &#34;tightness indicator&#34; go from red to green). As I said, it can be done, just be patient and do some stretching before you try to get it in there because you're going to have to play contortionist to apply the pressure needed to lock everything in place.<br /><br />But back to the good stuff. It's also very nice that you can rock the seat when you put it down. So if baby gets a little fussy, you can start to gently, or quickly if you wish, rock her. And you can do so with your hand or your foot. Convenient. But that's, again, probably something most if not all baby seats will do.

0,1,0,0,1,,"We received 3 of these, so I can say with certainty that the problems listed below were not unique to one bad 'lemon'.<br /><br />While this is lightweight, as advertised, there were several issues.<br /><br />1.) The headrest is secured by a small piece of Velcro which is insufficient to the job.<br />2.) The slot for inserting the seat belt for rear-facing installation is too small to fit your hand through, oddly shaped, and has sharp plastic edges which scrape your hand. In order to install the seat belt, the fabric cover of the car seat needs to be un-clipped, and then you can access the slot from both sides of the hold and feed the belt through.<br />3.) The button/lever for releasing tension on the straps located between their feet is located in a very small hole cut out of the plastic frame. When you pull your thumb or finger out of the hole, it catches on the plastic edge and cuts your thumb. I had a rather gruesome experience with this, and had a friend and a daycare professional test it and they both were shocked at how sharp the plastic edge was and how easily it caught their thumb.<br />4.) My child who is 7mo old, and average weight/height for her age, does not look comfortable in the seat. It looks like she is sinking into it, and her lower back is not supported, so she is sitting in a C-shape posture.<br /><br />I was excited by the low price of these car seats, and that they were advertised as light weight and easy to take in and out of vehicles, but they are unsafe for the caregiver, and not a good fit for the child.",289,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear-facing

One, the leg straps are incredibly tight. Two, it's pretty difficult to unbuckle the crotch buckle to get them out. It's taken some time to figure it out, and it's still difficult.

We had Evenflo Triumphs which we will need for his new baby brother so I wanted to find something that will eventually convert into a booster but keep him 5 point harnessed as long as possible.  This seat is wonderful!  Many reviewers will tell you that this is the best seat on the market as far as adjusting the harness for tall children.  My son is tall for his age and we still have tons of room to bump the seat up so he can still be safely in the 5 point harness as he grows.  Second plus:  I can safely install this all by myself!!! I won't even touch those triumphs and I always make my husband handle the installation - but this is so simple - I've installed it twice in my car by myself with no problems - doesn't move an inch!
