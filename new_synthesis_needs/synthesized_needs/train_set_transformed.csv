0,2,0,0,0,,"I've owned this car seat for two years now, so I'll point out the things I like about it.<br />I own a Toyota Camry. This seat is installed on the side front facing. My son just turned 6 and is still in the 5-point harness (note- harness can be used until your child is 65 lbs and 50 inches tall). I've had no problems getting this seat super tight using LATCH.<br />Last year my son threw up in this seat and it had to be taken apart and cleaned. It was irritating just like any other seat, but I put the whole cover in the machine and there wasn't any damage done to it. (The fabric and straps on this seat don't have any visible deformities despite it being over two years old.) When I did take it apart, it was nice to see how well padded it is.<br />One good thing, but also bad thing, about this seat is how wide it is. If you're not planning to put a third person in your backseat, it's not a big deal. However, my other son's car seat is a Recaro Proride (also notoriously wide) so any third passenger back there has to be either an older child or a very uncomfortable adult. The good thing about it being so wide is that it's comfortable for my son. On long trips he likes to cross his legs and will fall asleep that way.<br />The only other &#34;complaint&#34; I have about this seat is the cupholders. They are not plastic all the way around, but held by a strip of elastic, so something like a toy car is going to slide right out. Top heavy drinks have fallen out during turns. They are irritating, but all the good things outweigh this one small issue.",302,Yes,"Seat Type: Forward Facing

This carseat is 4 lbs and up. Consider this if you're having twins, who are usually low birthweight and a bit early!<br /><br />We like it and find it very easy to manage. The strap on the back gets stuck sometimes when you are putting the baby back in, and that's annoying, but otherwise it's good.<br /><br />Two things I didn't know as a first time parent:<br />- You'll have to get a new car seat (a convertible carseat) in about a year. This is only for a little baby. FYI - maybe everyone else knows this already but I didn't<br />- You can use the carseat without a base in a pinch! You do it with the seatbelt.

Instillation was not too difficult, though it was a tight squeeze to fit it in a sedan facing backwards. You basically had to put the front seat up as far as it could go to install the seat and only someone with short legs could fit after the seat was installed. Once we flipped the seat to forward facing we no longer had that problem. The seat itself is very high quality and easy to use. My little girl loves her seat and seems very comfortable.

The only way I could find to do it, was to remove the entire car seat and guess how tight the LATCH straps need to be, then re-install, then remove and tighten or loosen, then re-install, etc. There is no way to simple install the base and then tighten as instructed.<br /><br />Installation was a HUGE pain overall. And it doesn't come with a locking clip so you can do it the &#34;old fashioned&#34; way. So if you don't have LATCH, you'll have to order the stupid clip.<br /><br />It fits nicely into the top of the coordinating stroller, but it doesn't release easily. I find myself yanking and jiggling it to get it to release.<br /><br />It's nearly impossible to press the red buttons on the sides of the carrying handle in order to move the handle out of the way (so you can get baby out). You have to squeeze them REALLY hard and at times jiggle the handle around to get them to release.<br /><br />The cover for the baby's feet? It was all ripped up on the inside within two weeks.

2,1,0,0,3,,"I’ll say, the expandability and great safety rating make this seat almost perfect, but as some of the other reviewers have stated it does take up quite a bit of space. We have a VW Atlas (which is pretty large) and we still have a limit on how far the seat in front of this car seat can move. For me, though, the biggest pet-peeve with this car seat is how much of a headache it is to clean our other car seat is slightly worse (it’s a Cybex something or other) but they both have a solid D- in the cleanability department.<br /><br />When your kid has that inevitable car spit-up (and it will happen), expect it to run down deep into the cracks and crevices of this thing and fight your every effort to get it out. Once it’s in there, your only hope is bleach water and a hose with a strong sprayer attached. If you’re ever able to purge it of that unmistakable stench of upchucked milk, you’ll now face the formidable challenge of getting it dry. You’d think that would be the easy part, but unless you live in some warm, arid climate, you’ll go through the twilight zone episode that is thinking you’ve gotten all the water out, picking it up to put it back in the vehicle, and then having it start leaking all over again.

2,2,0,0,1,,"This is the only car seat new parents are going to need.  It's designed to work from newborn all the way to 100 lbs, and while I initially dismissed the claim as hyperbolic sales talk...it's actually accurate.  I tried this seat in those age ranges and it worked very well for all of them.<br /><br />This seat also has a lot of design innovations, so many that, yes, it kind of makes me want to have another child.  Certainly though, it makes the old fogey parent in me kind of grumble about how easy parents these days have it.  Really.  But here, let's start at the beginning.<br /><br />This is a very sturdy, very overbuilt car seat.  It's designed to nestle your child in layers of protection, and unlike car seats from even ten years ago, a lot of attention is paid to child comfort as well.  Padding is generous and firm enough to last the 6-7 years you'll be using it.  Covers are easily removed and machine washable.  The frame is pretty beefy and has staying power.  Hence, when Safety 1st says this will be the only seat you need, they really did build it with that claim in mind.<br /><br />Innovations abound.  For example, on older car seats when your child grows you need to rethread the safety harness through the appropriate slots on the back of the seat.  Not so with this.  No, there are two thumb clamps you squeeze and then you can unlock the back of the seat and move it up or down.  That's right, no rethreading needed, and the adjustment is fine enough to give your chlld a more or less custom fit.  More importantly, you DON'T need to remove the car seat from the car to make this adjustment.  Adjusting harness tension is easy, with the adjustment strap and clamp in the front of the car seat.<br /><br />Another innovation are harness clips on either side of the seat, in which you can place the shoulder harness straps and make getting your child in and out of the car seat that much easier.  Having something like that (as opposed to fishing behind your kid for the shoulder straps after you put him in the seat) is a serious convenience.<br /><br />Two built-in cupholders are included, rubber lined and sized just right for a sippy cup.<br /><br />Instructions are clear for when it's time to convert this into a booster seat.  The harness and buckle all stow away, and there's a clear channel (marked with a helpful red patch) through which the seatbelt is threaded.  It works, and works well.  Moreover, it's still comfortable, thanks to all that padding. My five year old didn't want to get out of it.<br /><br />So in sum, this is an outstanding car seat, one that I think is best in class, and one that pays attention to the future of your family.  I never liked having to pay money every couple of years for a new car seat, so seeing a product like this that makes such an outlay unnecessary is fantastic.

The fabric is very nice, quality stitching. Chest straps are cushioned well and have sort of an anti-slip texture on the back side. That comes in super handy for us parents with those kids that love to adjust their own straps when they shouldn’t!<br /><br />It folds for travel, although you might rethink that because this thing is BEAST! It is heavy! I’ve lugged caresses through the airport before, but I’m not sure I’d recommend this one for travel.<br /><br />It also has a nice memory foam cushion in the seat.<br /><br />Now as far as using the seat, I don’t have much input on the infant or reverse stages. I used it for a few months in the forward facing five point harness stage. And currently using the high back booster. I felt comfortable with my daughter’s safety in both stages. It was just as easy to install as our chicco.<br /><br />Initially I was not a fan of the seat belt placement of the chest strap. On our other booster there is a plastic holder that you slide the belt into and with the Diono you just slide it beside the headrest. It just seemed a little awkward for placement, but it’s worked fine and I used to it now.<br /><br />I love the slim design. I always have two car seats in my vehicle and it can be difficult squeezing between them, when you need that third seat. I wish my other car seat was like this one! And even though it’s slimmer, my little still had plenty of seat room.<br /><br />It took my a second to figure out the cup holder! Just shove it in there and turn! Again another thing that initially threw me, but now it makes so much more sense!<br /><br />And with the 120 lb weight maximum, I don’t anticipate ever having to buy another car seat!<br /><br />Overall, I’m really impressed.

It is very secure in our car and it doesn't take up nearly as much space compared to our last seat, which is a big deal because we have to squeeze 3 kids in the back of our jetta. My daughter usually isnt able to see out the window and the first time she rode in it, it was like she was seeing everything for the first time. She was soo happy looking out the window and telling us everything she saw. And the first time she rode in it she fell asleep and I was so happy to be able to try out the amazing recline feature. The recline feature is a huge bonus and I know it will come in handy with all the trips we take. I know some other reviews talked about the fabric being poorly constructed but I would have to disagree. I know we haven't had it long enough to wash it but the construction looks like high quality and i am not worried about it coming apart. Overall I love this seat and would recommend it to anyone.

It has a very narrow profile so it helped me get three seats in the back seat of a sedan. I love the strap height adjuster in the back. It makes it super easy to raise the strap height as they grow without having to take the straps apart. The canopy is nice and large and provides a lot of coverage from the sun.<br /><br />The cons: The handle is very difficult to adjust. The buttons are super hard to push down in order to tip it into a different position. I struggle with it every single time, and my wrists and hands were really sore when we first got the seat. The seat is heavy and awkward to carry a baby around in - though I think all bucket seats are like this, which is why I don't often carry them around in the seat. The buckle is a puzzle piece, so you have to piece it together before putting both pieces into the crotch part of the buckle. This is really ridiculous as the only reason for it I can figure out is that it is preventing the child from being able to buckle themselves into the seat - it still releases just as easily. I'm not sure why we would want to prevent baby's from buckling themselves in, and none I know of would ever master this skill while still in this seat anyway, so every time I have to do the annoying puzzle piece buckle I wonder what they were thinking with that one. Also, the base doesn't fit in my car very well. It seems to sit not level from left to right and I try adjusting it all the time with no success. Without a pool noodle it sits very upright and there wasn't enough room to adjust the base so that didn't happen. With a pool noodle it sits at a better angle, but I'm having the off level issue then.

There is a simple latch in the back of the seat that you pull and the car seat pops out.<br />2) The canopy is excellent and provides a decent amount of coverage.<br />3)  Great safety rating.<br />4)  Our babies were small when we left the hospital and we needed an insert (Summer Infant Snuzzler) to stabilize their head but they did really well with that simple fix.<br />5)  It fits the City Select stroller with a simple adapter.  The adapter snaps into the stroller and then the car seat snaps into the adapter without requiring any complicated or bulky stabilizing bars or straps. The adapters do not have to be removed to collapse the stroller. If you have twins, the only way both car seats will fit the stroller is if they are both facing you. This places the rear baby below the front baby.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) We struggled a bit with the base installation (rear facing) because our back seats are sloped (bucket like).  Even though the marker was within the limits of the level and should have been fine, the car seat was tilted slightly forward causing the babies' heads to flop forward as well. There is a recline adjustment button for the base but it wasn't nearly enough to rectify the tilt. It turns out this is not an infrequent problem and Britax has a youtube video on correcting this. I'm not sure if other car seats have more range in the tilt to accommodate for this problem.<br />2) For installing without the base, the seat belt guides are hidden under the cover so it's a pain to access them to install the seat.<br />3) The cushion coverings can be removed but they're not machine washable.<br />4) The car seats are wide relative to some others so it makes your middle seat virtually useless unless you have a really skinny person.<br />5)  This is a MAJOR con.  Because the car seats are wide, there isn't a single or double snap-n-go on the market that fits the car seats. That means you are committed to your stroller as your only travel system. We like our City Select stroller but the frame is heavy and requires removal of the 2nd seat mounting brackets to fit in the trunk.  For short distances, it's a drag to have to set up the frame.

We kept our slim, average-height daughter rear-facing in her Graco Snugride 35 bucket seat until she grew too tall for the straps (22 months, 22 lbs), then started looking for a convertible seat for her to use for the next several years.  After subscribing to Consumer Reports and reading everything I could find on the internet, I narrowed it down to this seat and the Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 based on safety features and user reviews, considering ease of use, comfort, and vehicle fit.  I just couldn't decide, but I knew we would want two seats (one for my CRV and one for my husband's Tahoe), so we bought one of each.  The Maxi-Cosi went in my car, the Britax went in the Tahoe.  I really like them both (and my daughter has no complaints) but I like the Maxi-Cosi better for the following reasons:<br />--the fabric feels and looks nicer and like it will be cooler in the summer (we live in TX)<br />--the seat feels much more cushiony<br />--the &#34;wings&#34; around her head offer significantly more coverage in case of a crash. They also give her head more support. (I was afraid she wouldn't like them because she can't really turn her head to the side, but she doesn't seem to mind so far.)<br />--the Maxi-Cosi has a nice cupholder and more room for her toys to sit with her.<br />--the Britax between-the-legs buckle is strangely positioned -- she's almost sitting on it.<br /><br />Both seats are attractive and fit well (enough) in the vehicles rear-facing. We have only one child, so she sits in the middle seat.  If there were more than one seat, it might start to be an issue in my CRV, but she will be forward-facing before we have another kid, so I'm not too concerned.<br /><br />The Britax does win, hands-down, in one area so far: cleaning.  The M-C seat has to be taken apart to get the cover off, and then has to be hand-washed (what were they thinking?!).  The Britax seat cover comes off easily and washes well.  I know this because it got thoroughly broken in with a spilled cup of milk AND A bout of diarrhea on its very first outing -- UGH!  We were grateful to be able to yank the seat cover off with no trouble, hose it down, and toss it in the washer.  The trickiness of washing it is a definite downside of the Maxi-Cosi, but we're hoping to minimize the issue by not allowing her to eat or drink in that seat. So the fancy cupholder is just for toys, but that still comes in handy.<br /><br />The bottom line is, both seats are terrific and seem very safe, and I would recommend either.",469,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear Facing, Convertible

1,2,0,0,0,,"UPDATED NOV 2008<br />I have owned this car seat since March and have it installed with Latch long method since my daughter is still under 40 lbs (see manual) with the incline bar in place in the back of the seat. It is installed in a 2003 Honda Odyssey in the bucket seat behind the driver's seat.<br /><br />I came home from shopping today to find my daughter in the seat and the end of one of the shoulder straps in her lap!  Broken.  I removed the seat from my car and upon turning it over found that the strap had completely frayed in the spot where it comes to end in the black metal clip underneath the seat. The elastic piece that holds the seat cover onto the seat has snapped in several places also.  The other shoulder strap is about 50% frayed in its black metal clip. The seat elastic on that side looks undamaged.<br /><br />I called Britax and was told that there is no recall on any of the Regents. They are sending me replacement straps and buckles free of charge.  They were nice but did not seem concerned.<br /><br />My daughter is only 38 pounds, so we have a long way to go to the 80 pound limit.  I am of course disappointed and alarmed.<br /><br />And now for the if's:<br />If the straps frayed once, what are the chances that the new ones will do the same? When I originally installed the seat I took it to the police station and they confirmed that the seat was installed properly.  However, in looking at the seat in my living room, I am wondering if the seat itself was reclined too far, thus putting all of the weight of the seat onto the back where the straps are and not on the seat bottom and causing the damage. If that is the case I feel like there is a design flaw, considering that I did have the incline bar installed.<br /><br />I am just left wondering, what happened?! I feel like I wasted $200, and am trying to decide whether to purchase something else altogether or try installing this seat differently when I receive the replacement parts...  I was really hoping that this seat would be the one that would last until we didn't need any type of seat anymore, as I prefer the 5 point harness over the shoulder/lap belt on a regular booster.  If you own this seat, PLEASE check it to make sure your straps are still intact.<br /><br />Original Review<br />We purchased this seat for our three year old and gave the Roundabout to her infant brother.

Because the seat is so large I do worry that as my daughter's legs get longer she's going to be somewhat crunched; she sits behind the driver's seat, and I can only move my seat so far forward to give her room. The seat was easy to install with LATCH.<br /><br />The reason I am only giving the seat four stars is because even though the five point harness can be used up to 80 lbs, the seat is only supposed to be installed with LATCH up to 50 lbs. This is per the manual that comes with the seat. After that the seat is supposed to be installed with a regular seatbelt. The whole reason I wanted this seat is because it went up to 80 with the 5 point harness, and I thought that was using LATCH the whole time; I would have liked to know that it only went up to 50 with LATCH before I bought it. I just wonder how much safer it is having a seat with the five point harness when it's only installed with the seatbelt.",673,Yes,"Seat Type: Forward Facing

2,1,0,0,2,,"It is difficult to get the straps to be even. The straps that come out near the leg are also part of the straps that go over the shoulder. This doesn't seem like a big deal until you have a squirming 1yr old you are trying to buckle in. When I try to pull on her shoulder strap to even them out it either pulls it too tight on her legs or her other shoulder. So what I usually end up with is one side of her body being too tight and the other being either the right tightness or too loose. It's not like I can tell a 1yr old to sit straight for a few minutes while I get you strapped in. It would be better of the leg/hip restraints were on a separate strap so each could be adjusted as needed without effecting the whole harness. This is the first car seat of this type I have had to buy, so maybe this how they all are or maybe I am doing something wrong, but it seems like they could change this part to make it a little easier to get them correctly strapped in.<br /><br />It is also a GIANT hassle to get it in and out of the car. When they (twins) were in the pumpkin style seats, we had Graco and the anchor straps had a button release system to tighten or loosen the anchor strap. This car seat has a tilt forward buckle, which in my experience, never loosens. So if I have to switch the car seats to my mom's car for example, I usually have to put a lot of downward pressure on the seat to give me enough slack to force feed the strap through the belt buckle to loosen the anchor strap enough to where I can unlatch the anchor hooks. I know this part isn't designed to be easy, to keep the seat in place in the event of a wreck, but the graco one was a forceful push of a button to allow slack on the anchor strap. I could swap both of my graco bases in less than 10 minutes, while it takes me 10-15 minutes each to wrestle with these to get them securely in the other car (and I never feel like I can get the anchor strap tight enough).<br /><br />Summary: If given the choice, I would not buy this again and if we had extra money, I would buy different seats and give these away.",423,Yes,"Harness Type: The straps are difficult to get even; the leg/hip restraints and shoulder straps are connected, making adjustment problematic.

I'm not in the financial position to get a new seat - my father bought this for us. Next, the red piece at the bottom front of the seat (that changes the recline) broke off. It was stuck and I did not realize it - and I thought I wasn't pulling it right, so I pulled harder and it broke off. Now I can't ever change the recline again.

But alas, I'm a pretty wimpy soccer mom armed only with a light sabre and a 12 pack of juice boxes, so a lousy review is all I have.<br /><br />The good: The fabric is nice and cleans up easily.  I don't generally let my children eat in the car, but if I did, I don't think the fabric would stain. The seat feels well made, with solid materials and heavy plastics that instill a sense of confidence. The cup holders and the ingenious toy hiding cubby are awesome. That's it. That's all the good there is. I have not had issues with the buckle. It may be because I do not let the children eat the car.<br /><br />The bad: This thing is heavy. That's not always bad, but it's almost unmanageable. I have Recaro seats that I like a lot. They're heavy, too, but somehow they don't seem as bad. The seat is very hard to install, with old school latch connectors that are nearly impossible to attached to the rear deck hooks in a sedan. It takes me almost 15 minutes to install this seat properly using the latch connectors.  I have yet to try installing it with the seat belt - it may take away some of the intense vitriol I feel for this seat.<br /><br />The ugly: My son is 5 and 37 lbs. He cannot get himself into this seat in my relatively easy access VW Passat. The seat is &#34;bucket&#34; style, with a considerable incline, even after adjustment.  Because of the incline, the buckle is always facing the child's posterior. As a result, he's always sitting on it and you have to reach under his hind quarters to reach the buckle. I've read other reviews, looked at the instructions and researched YouTube, but the crotch strap is surprisingly short with an insufficient number of slots. It's ok for a younger child, but as your child gets older it's an awkward exchange to get him in and out of the seat. It's actually an episode to get my son into the seat. He cries, complains, and begs me to loosen the straps. The seat hurts his butt, and as a smaller kid, he finds it difficult to overcome the incline in order to get himself out of the car. Combine that with the never ending winter and mornings consistently in the 20+ below 0F range up here in the tundra, it takes unreasonably long to get a kid comfortably and properly into this seat. I gave up and put him in a belt tensioning booster. This thing wasn't worth it, and after less than a year, I kicked it to the curb.<br /><br />Yes, I know, they should be in a 5 point until they're 32 because it's just that much safer. Yes. I agree. If you have a 7 or 8 year old that is happily in a 5 point harness, you're clearly a better parent than I who has exceptionally gifted children. For us mortals who need to balance practicality with safety, this seat just doesn't cut it. I replaced it with a Recaro seat that I am very happy with. The 5 year old agrees.<br /><br />Clearly, this is a very popular seat with a whole host of parents that think this bad boy is the cat's meow. Frankly, it's the worst $150 I've ever spent. I just hate it that much. Do your research, test it out.  Maybe it will work for you.

So far we've only used the rear-facing with harness seat for our infant. I really like that there's a lot of cushioning and support with the infant insert. It helps keep their head for bobbling all around and provides surrounding protection from all sides. I think this is a crucial feature because a baby's head and neck are so fragile and must be fully supported at all times. The harness is easy to tighten/loosen and holds them firmly in place while driving. It also comes with padding on the arm rests, which believe or not, a lot of car seats don't have.

0,0,0,0,1,,It only works well as an infant seat to grace our living room. Since this was our first ( and hopefully ) only infant car seat I did not know at first just how tough and lacking this seat is. The positives are that it is very soft and comfortable. Our baby loved sleeping in it. The installation with base was pretty good although it could only get JUST TIGHT ENOUGH with the latch system on our Mazda CX-5. The cord is not long enough to ratchet it tighter so it seemed tight enough but I could not pull any tighter.<br /><br />Now onto the cons and these are severe enough that I would NEVER suggest this car seat to ANYONE unless it was an emergency. The Carseat attachments for the popular UPPABABY stroller are not secure and this seat moves AT LEAST 3 inches forward and backwards. Yes it does not fall but it doe snot create any confidence. ThE STRAPS.. oh the tightening straps . As you might have read countless other times. The straps get caught on the underside of the plastic bottom and you CANNOT pull them tight from the front of the unit. WE HAVE TO take the seat out of the car to tighten the straps. They get tangled underneath EVERY time. It sucks. I have had to rethread the straps at least 15 times and I have to tighten him in it outside the car. Removing the seat from the car is also really hard as you have to tilt the seat to the side and pull it sideways as the seat gets caught if you try to pull it from any other angle. The release buttons for the stroller  are so deep and hidden on either side that you need 2 hands to undo the buttons even though you need another hand to lift the chair!!!<br /><br />FINALLY as others have mentioned the carry bar clicks very loud and will wake any baby when you adjust it ( both hands are needed once again) . I realize this may be a safety thing to register that it is locked  but the click is so loud it will wake any baby and dog sleeping nearby. I don't normally write many reviews but I just wanted to pass the word. It's a relatively affordable chair that is built well and cozy BUT you cannot loosen and tighten this 90% of the time.

0,0,0,2,0,,"I used to not be a huge fan of this carseat; however, after extended use, my opinion has really changed. I now LOVE this carseat!<br /><br />When I was first researching an infant carseat to purchase, I went back and forth between the Gracco Snugride and the Chicco Keyfit. I ended up choosing this Chicco mainly because it seemed much more comfortable than the Gracco (and more attractive). Well, I'm glad I did for numerous reasons. First of all, it really does seem like a very comfortable carseat. Our son has even spent a few nights in it when he has had a cold and couldn't lay flat comfortably in his crib. On those rare occasions he sleeps soundly for 12 hours and always wakes up happy. That tells me that the carseat must be pretty comfortable. He is also always very happy in his carseat, and doesn't get fussy when we are out running errands and such.<br /><br />Also, the release button that lets the straps in and out is a Godsend! Also, I like that even though it is a 22 pound carseat, it still holds a baby up to 30 inches. Some of the competitors 22 pound seats only go up to 26 inches. Therefore, I expect that our 7.5 months old (who is very tall) should be able to stay in it for another month or two. Just for reference, this carseat should be technically be able to hold even the largest babies, for up to 6 months. 22 pounds and 30 inches is above the 95th percentile for a 6 month old baby.<br /><br /> I've also had some experience carrying infants in other carseats, and I'd say this one is much lighter and easier to handle. At 17 pounds, our son is starting to get a little too heavy to carry around in the carseat, so I'm glad we did not go with a larger 30 pound seat. I can't imagine carrying around a baby that heavy in a carseat!<br /><br />The only thing that I still don't like about this carseat is that it doesn't have that little notch on the bottom that allows it to fit into the front of shopping carts. Also, it didn't seem to fit our son very well when we took him home from the hospital at 5 pounds. We ended up folding up a burpcloth and putting it behind his back for the first few months. Otherwise, he seemed to ""sink"" into the carseat. However, I definitely think the pros outweigh the cons!",426,Yes,"Seat Type: infant carseat

2,0,1,0,0,,"First of all, I'm an Art Director in advertising. So I understand doing things to make a product shot more appealing. But the photos of this seat are so misleading I felt I had to write a review. Let me start by saying, &#34;Shame on us&#34; in the first place. We were so overwhelmed at Baby's-R-Us by the over-abundance of options that we just went with a name we new and picked a color. So, I guess what I do for a living is working. I suggest you really explore these things at the store if you can. Also take this with a grain of salt as I'm a MAN and just expect things to work.<br /><br />In the photos (and even in the display model at the store) this seat appears very cushy. Padded. Even &#34;Snug&#34; in fact. However it has felt very flimsy and hard ever since we got it. There is nothing SNUG about how our baby sits in this seat.<br /><br />Yesterday we had a little &#34;blowout&#34; in the car seat (if you don't know what that is yet, you'll find out; Daddies of the world). In having to take all the &#34;cushions&#34; off, I realized just how bad this thing is. It's a hard plastic shell with a hard piece of Styrofoam. Assuming that's passable for the Crash Test Baby's, there's barely a baby blanket of padding in the actual seat cushions. The piece in the photo that appears to be a nice padded head restraint is a flat piece of junk that is not attached to anything and falls down behind our baby's back. It has less foam than the earphones on my 1982 Walkman and provides NO support around her head. Whenever she falls asleep, she is hunched over with a clear future with Daddy's chiropractor.<br /><br />This morning while re-assembling the &#34;pads&#34; (yes, I'm physically doing air-quotes while I tell this story) I decided it was finally warm enough to put away the fleece cover we'd bought and ad the canopy back on that came with the seat. Well, if this wasn't enough of a disappointing product in the first place, the canopy will make you wonder how this hasn't ended up in a sitcom already.<br /><br />As a man, and a gear-head I don't mind tinkering with things I want to modify or give MORE POWER (insert Tim Allen grunt), but when I buy something this simple, I expect it to just WORK. If I were to simply leave the handle in the carrying position (like in the fine photos of this product), this long-winded rant would not exist. But the Powers That Be in the world have made it very clear that the handle needs to be folded down while in the car and when you sit the car seat down... oh HEY, side note, speaking of The Powers That Be...<br /><br />I just realized this photo also doesn't show the 15+ CYA (Cover Your Ass) legal stickers and patches (in both English and Spanish) that are not only all over this seat including the cushions, but they are in no way REMOVABLE! So whatever beauty this thing might have had when it was designed is gone! But hey, at least there are plenty of reminders (in two non-removable languages) that Graco is just another behemoth company with a staff of attorneys that don't give a damn about the safety or comfort of my baby girl.<br /><br />So back to the canopy...You can't MOVE THE HANDLE when the canopy is on. It will only go part way back and nowhere near the  position required when you set the car seat down.<br /><br />In short (I know. I know)... for $140 I'm in the upper price bracket and expected to be in the higher quality bracket. You'd be FAR better off spending a little more for a much higher quality car seat, both for your sanity and your baby's comfort and safety.",661,Yes,"Material: appears very cushy, padded, snug; felt very flimsy and hard; hard plastic shell with a hard piece of Styrofoam; barely a baby blanket of padding; flat piece of junk; less foam; provides NO support; canopy; fleece cover; cushions; pads; 15+ CYA legal stickers and patches; non-removable

I purchased this Peg Perego Convertible Car Seat on May 6th 2013 from AMAZON. We purchased it because we were headed to the beach. We rented a Tahoe and the car seat fit well and we were pleased. Once we got home from the beach we attempted to install this seat in my BMW 328i but it was too tight. I was planning on getting a new car within months and we decided to just wait on installing until we got the new car. A few month later in August we purchased a BMW X5. We installed the Peg Perego Convertible Car Seat into the X5 and were very happy. My son loved the extra room, and it worked for us. Now we have been using the seat for 2 to 3 months and the fabric is completely torn and open at the buckle. Considering how much we paid for this car seat, I do not think this is acceptable.<br /><br />I went to amazon returns link, and it says my return expired Aug 7, 2013. It gives me no other ways of contacting them. I have no idea how I can somehow contact AMAZON to try to get a refund or even a replacement. I am very familiar with Peg Perego products we have many of there products, and something like this has never happen before. This is unacceptable and I am very disappointed.

Diono was hard and too wide on top for three across.  The top corners of the head rest made it very difficult to close the door in my 2020 xc90.  Graco is narrow in the shoulder area. Liked the Clek booster but the seat has crazy hard cushion and the worse part was the height of the back of the seat. Height of the seat reached under my son’s mid back and the seat bottom was under his mid thigh.  My son could not stand it.  It’s very simple, sleek and stylish but maybe not the most comfortable for my son at least.  Great rigid latch system on the Clek but my son literally asked me to send it back after our test ride in it.  My son liked the Maxi Cosi. The cushion was very comfortable but like the Graco we tried, it restricted his arm movements as the shoulder width was narrow.  The Volvo seat is not worth mentioning. What a piece of crap!

4,2,1,1,0,,"**I want to start this review off saying that I am extremely unimpressed that Graco markets this seat for children as young as three years old. Three year olds and most four year olds do NOT belong in belt positioning boosters as their bones are much too immature to withstand the forces of a crash with the adult seatbelt, and the kids themselves are also not mature enough to stay in position so the belt can do it's job. Car seat manufacturers are just now starting to take the initiative to raise their minimums for their car seats, so it would be wonderful if Graco can do that too.**<br /><br />As for the actual seat itself, this is a good budget seat for children over the age of 5. It is not extremely wide so it can fit in a variety of vehicles, and it provides a great belt fit where the shoulder belt lies firmly in the middle of the shoulder and the lap belt lies flat on the child's hips/top of their thighs. It is very lightweight and easy to move around to other vehicles, and it is also comfortable for kids of all different sizes. The headwings are substantial enough to support the child's head when they are sleeping, and many kids can comfortably rest their heads on the side instead of flopping out of position.<br /><br />Downsides: There is assembly required when you buy this booster, and often times parents throw out or misplace the bag that comes with two little screws which you're supposed to put in the armrests of the booster. This is an extremely important step that will make the seat work correctly in a crash. I think it would be very beneficial for the manufacturer to either have the screws pre-installed, or put a large indication right on the seat itself that the screws need to be in there.",317,Yes,"Seat Type: belt positioning booster

You are required to remove the seat cover to run the car's seatbelt underneath where it also has 2 clips to clamp down on the seatbelt.  You have to push down on the seat and pull the belt as tight as possible and then force down these clips.  Once installed you of course would need to put the cover back however it has to clip in multiple places on the underside of the front of the seat...which is now pressed very firmly against the back of your car!  The tighter you install the seat the harder it will be to replace the seat cover.<br /><br />Once installed usage was horrible.  There are 2 sets of straps one of which is only a few inches long and stationary near the top of the large main straps.  This means most of the ways that you would instinctively grab the straps to pull and loosen them to remove your child will not loosen them but instead simply pull on these weird smaller straps and stop.  You essentially have to leave the chest clip connected and pull on it specifically to get the main straps to loosen.<br /><br />Then there are these weird rigid rubber things on the front.  They are too large get in the way.  I think they pinched my baby at least once and made her cry and simply made it difficult to loosen or tighten the straps (second part of the design which inhibited its function).  If I had kept this seat I most definitely would have removed these weird giant pieces of hard rubber.<br /><br />The last straw for me was that I noticed when I finally could tighten the straps they did not apply even pressure.  I would get them tight but while on her left side it was extremely snug her right side was still loose, enough to easily get at least a finger under.  I checked the straps throughout and never noticed anything out of position or twisted.  It seemed to be a flaw in the design where things connected in the back of the seat using a metal bracket which didn't seem to apply pressure evenly.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this seat is that it fit easily in my backseat which is small enough to have been a challenge and certainly some seats, like our Recaro, would not fit properly.

Just some information that may help potential buyers - My daughter is a little over 20 lbs and 29 inches. We took out the top insert around the head area but left the bottom insert for now, and she fits comfortably and seems to like it. We use it rear-facing in the middle seat of our 2006 Toyota Highlander, and I was able to fit another forward facing car seat and a high-backed booster on either side to transport a friend's children. I like that it comes with belt covers where the belts touch her neck, and it seems durable and like it would be easy to clean. We paid around 170, but I saw it on sale later for 135 and wish I would have waited. 170 was a little high. We have had no issues with accessing the release lever that loosens the straps.

0,1,3,0,3,,"This is our first convertible seat after using a Graco infant seat for the first 1.5 years.  I was looking for a breathable material because my child is always hot and sweaty. I liked that this seat had that option and it seems meshy enough that it *might* work.<br /><br />The biggest reason we chose this one is the strap to tighten it pulls so smoothly and effortlessly.  We tried it in the store and were blown away how much easier it was. I got it 3 months ago and I’m loving everything about it.  The Graco infant seat was annoying to adjust and I felt I had to pull very hard to get it right enough for my child’s safety, but this is so smooth and easy to pull. This alone has been such a stress reliever when leaving the house.<br /><br />My second favorite feature is the Clicktight mechanism. I’ve heard how difficult and annoying it is to switch convertible seats between cars, but I’m not even joking that it takes two minutes to move this one.  I was surprised that it recommends the seatbelt rather than the latch system. It’s SO much faster and easier. No standing on the seat and tugging a strap to tighten it (y’all know you’ve done it!) or breaking your hands trying to undo the latch hooks buried in the abyss of your seat.  You just stretch the seatbelt across and close the seat down to clamp it in. I don’t know how it works but it gets a tight fit every single time with zero wiggle.

2,1,3,0,3,,"I purchased the updated Britax Boulevard (ClickTight) about a year ago after owning two previous versions of the Britax Boulevard 70 (about 3 years old).  Based on the pictures I see on Amazon, my older version is similar to the Britax Boulevard G4 and not the 'new' ClickTight version which was not available 3 years ago.  In my opinion, this is a case where newer is not better.<br /><br />I believe that this new version has a number of serious flaws as I will describe below, the biggest of which is the ClickTight feature.  If you try to install the seat tightly (which is a fundamental goal when installing a car seat), you will find that, because of the way the ClickTight feature works, it is possible to lock the seat in so tightly that it cannot easily be uninstalled -- while I understand that is in part by design, it is very difficult to predict how loosely you have to install the seat in order for the tightness to be appropriate.  To uninstall the seat, you are forced to turn a small disk using your fingers in a way that you cannot generate sufficent leverage if you install the seat too tightly (which, as I mention, is part of the goal), and I ultimately had to use a vise grip just to uninstall the seat, causing damage to the car seat.  Prior to my involvement in installing the seat, my wife was completely unable to remove the seat as she could not turn the ClickTight disc at all.  I have installed/uninstalled this seat several times, and the difficulty of unlatching and removing the seat has been an issue nearly every time.<br /><br />The seat is also unnecessarily difficult to install, particularly in comparison to our prior Boulevard but also compared to other model car seats that we have used.  If you are used to having easy-on/off LATCH connectors (that's language from the description of the Boulevard G4, which has such easy to use connectors like most other carseats), forget about it here -- the Boulevard ClickTight has metal anchors which are both difficult to install and difficult to remove, forcing you to put pressure on the latch to hold it open while trying to latch blindly to the LATCH tethers.  Depending on your car, this could be a very difficult task.<br /><br />The ClickTight harness only allows certain degrees of snugness, often resulting in the harness feeling too tight or too loose.  I am used to pulling the harness strap tightly enough so that it feels snug but not so tightly that you feel like you're squeezing the air out of your child; with the new ClickTight harness, I find that, depending on how my child is dressed, I am either harnessing too tightly or too loosely, and rarely at the level of snugness and comfort that I can achieve with my other car seats.  I am not confident that the seat is sufficiently snug because there are only certain predefined levels of tightness.<br /><br />Once harnessed in, the release button is buried in a hold between your childs legs.  If you don't have particularly long fingers or are wearing gloves, you will likely find it difficult to conveniently push the button such that it releases the harness.  Keep in mind that you have to apply pressure to the button in the hole while at the same time pulling the straps forward in order to release them; it's not an impossible task, just made more difficult by Britax's design decision to put the button in a hole.

Although they claim they would respond within 48 hours, they did not honor that commitment.  After 10 days of non-response, I posted a public complaint via their website.  The complaint was reviewed by Britax and the response I got from them was that they could not publish my complaint publicly.  So, after 12 days of waiting for a response, the only response I got was that they wouldn't post my complaint.  I still have not received a response on my original complaint.  I'm posting the full correspondence for the public's benefit:<br /><br />Original Post:<br />Product + Customer Service FAIL!<br />I bought the Boulevard in preparation to transition my son into a toddler car seat. We were switching to Britax from a competitor brand, which we used as the infant car seat, because of a friend's recommendation. After a few months of use, the side wing of the foam head rest snapped off in the action of putting my son into the seat. I would have expected this piece to be able to withstand the repetitive motion of moving back and forth. As ANY parent would know, putting a child into a car seat is NOT like an adult settling into his favorite armchair: sometimes the angle is awkward, sometimes the child resists, sometimes the child stands. When the side wing snapped, there wasn't any particular struggle and nothing noticeably harsh and it clearly gave out of repetitive (though ROUTINE) use. I contacted Britax about this July 4th. Given that this was a holiday, I didn't expect an answer and gave them 3 days. On the evening of the 7th, I sent another question/complaint through their website. Since I still have not received a response (now July 12th), not even an auto-reply, I thought this warranted a public post so that future potential customers could be aware. On a side note, though no less important for safety conscious parents, in my question to Britax, I also mentioned that the toddler shoulder belts were unevenly tensioned when I tightened them around my son's shoulder. Even though I would pull the strap to tighten the belt, my son's left shoulder strap would still be loose while his right shoulder strap was tight. There was no obvious snag when I checked the back of the car seat. This issue was present from Day 1 of using the Boulevard. I continued using it because I could set the chest buckle higher to minimize the &#34;give&#34; in the looser shoulder strap.<br /><br />Britax Response:<br />Our staff has read your review and values your contribution even though it did not meet all our website guidelines.

I HATED the PP infant car seat (seating angle, canopy, base, etc) and went with the Britax Chaperone (LOVED it) so I was a tad hesitant about purchasing the PP convertible despite the stellar reviews. Our 10 month old is almost too long for the Chaperone so we decided to upgrade him to a ""big kid seat"". Luckily we were able to compare the Britax seats the PP non-leatherette seat (Crystal Beige, they didn't have the leatherette in store) at a local store and really loved all the features especially the recline angles and general comfort of the seat, but the thought of cleaning the jersey fabric with our little mess-ball was enough to give me a panic attack. The Paloma fabric is amazing! It's really expensive for a car seat, but spend the extra money for the leatherette fabric. It's definitively worth it and will save your sanity! Just a damp cloth and whatever the little man has caked on it comes right off without any fuss. No removing the fabric (even though you can); literally just wipe it down. Also, I have no problem fitting it in a sedan, CUV and full size SUV. It's smaller than the Chaperone in that sense, but still very roomy for the little guy.

They are unbelievable difficult to tighten the chest straps and I have to jump through hoops to get my child strapped in. It takes several minutes and tons of tugging to tighten and it still doesn't pass the pinch test. I've tried all of the hacks and they still do not allow me to get a snug fit on my child.

1,2,1,0,3,,"I too am wondering why the price is so expensive on here, compared to Walmart (where we bought ours).  The only thing I can think of is that this carseat is so high in demand, and sold out at many places, that they are selling it from a company with a really high price.  I would definately wait until the price goes down to get this seat.  That said, this carseat is absolutely the best one yet.  I origally wanted to buy one for my three year old nephew (who I care for) because his seat was getting outdated.  Instead, I ended up buying two of these, one for him and one for his 5 year old sister.  She was already in a plain booster seat, but I decided to buy this so she can be in a harness longer.  Now, she should fit with the harness until she is at least 7, which is a whole lot safer.  She actually doesn't mind being back in a carseat, because this seat is so cool, with it's cup holder and two ""secret treasure holders.""  I also love the buckle (which I can open with one hand) compared to my nephew's old system.  It is also easier for my neice to buckle the harness then to buckle herself into her booster seat using the car seat belt.  So much faster!  Another bonus, this carseat is also safe for one year olds on up.  I do home daycare and occasionally have different kids using the seats.  This carseat has straps that are the absolute easiest to adjust.  It litterally takes seconds. I origally thought the price of $150 was high (and that was when I was planning on buying just one!), but it truly is the last carseat you will need to buy.  It is a fantasic carseat and soo worth the price.  There are probably more expensive carseats that aren't as nice.

0,2,0,0,0,,"We really liked the Portabout 5 Evenflo infant carseat we had used with our 1st child but unfortunately we couldn't find that base when we were expecting our 2nd child.  So we went with Evenflo Brand again with the Discovery.<br /><br />I do like how it is rated for a little bit bigger child up to 22lbs / 29"" vs the 20lb / 26"" limit on the Portabout.  Both my boys have been big (9+lbs and one almost 23' long at birth) So the infant carseat won't work for them for too long.<br /><br />I never had a problem with either handle not staying where it was supposed to.<br /><br />Discovery is a bit harder to manuver a sleeping baby in and out of the car.  The hook on the front of the carseat needs to be tipped forward to hook in, then the back snaps down, so if baby is sleeping they are tipped forward to get hooked in. The portabout didn't have to be tipped as severly forward because there wasn't a hook it needed to hook into.  Some claim the Portabout was hard to get in and out, I never experienced this.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have with the Discovery is the flat piece that holds the 2 straps together tends to slide down.  I follow the instructions to slide it up to Baby's armpits height, but even if he's sleeping that piece slides down to about his stomach area, in a short 5 mile car ride.  I would say the seat would be greatly improved and rank a 5 star if they just replaced the sliding connector with the plastic clip one they used in the Evenflo Portabout.  Wherever I slide that one into position I find it stays put.  Personally I found a new base for the Portabout on the web and have ordered it.  I'm going to go back to the Portabout carseat.  The connector concerns me that if I were in an accident, I am not convinced he would stay in the seat very well.  I'll take the reduced size limit and get my 2 year old a booster seat combo and move my youngest into the convertable carseat when he gets too big for the Portabout.<br /><br />Hope this helps you make a safe decision for your little one.",389,Yes,"Seat Type: infant carseat, convertable carseat

As for the headrest, when my daughter sleeps, her head keeps falling down forward, rather than resting on the headrest or the back of the seat.

I read that people loved it and those that didn't had issues with it that didn't affect me so I decided to save about $100 and ordered this seat. I was excited but the more I've had the seat, the less thrilled I have been with it. Here are my likes/dislikes.<br /><br />Likes:<br />It has a handy dandy cup holder.<br />Has a harness and converts to a booster ""this will be the last seat my son may need!""<br />Did I mention the cup holder? yeah? ok...<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />The latch system.<br />Ignorance is bliss... If you have only ever used this brand perhaps this isn't an issue for you. However- I think every parent should know that there are MUCH MUCH better latching systems out there. These little metal clips are junk and the fact that in order to get the latching systems's belt pulled tightly I have to try to thread it through the seats back and try to pull the strap to the side (the direction of ""out"" of the car) all while kneeling in the seat to ensure its in snug is a pain and usually requires the help of another person. Pretty annoying for a do it yourself-er or someone that travels solo with the kids and doesn't enjoy doing this in an airport parking lot... or at all for that matter. We don't move the seats all that often (some parents transfer seats often- this seat would be a pain if you planned to use latches)but enough to be completely annoying and worry some. I'm a stickler for having my seats in snug with little to NO wobble.<br /><br />Seat Parts-<br />So- kids are dirty. This seat was made to be able to wash the pads/cover Yay (oops that should be a plus) BUT- after removing the seat pads and pieces a foam piece on the headrest that states DO NOT REMOVE fell right off. (its not attached- just sort of hangs there). Ok, no big deal- pop it back on. Well- not a big deal until your child comes by and the piece snaps in half (I swear he barely touched it). My first thought... ok maybe 2nd. First thought was gee I'm pissed. Then- okay- quick- give a call and order a new one! Not open and before and after I tried calling I tried their web page. Followed the directions in entering the model and serial number and its not working. Must be an issue because after the first of many tires there was a pop up to call the 800 number.<br /><br />so- third negative- difficult to get to the parts ordering section of the web page with this seat's model number. (are those Ohs or zeros? hmm neither work! What about a space here, one there? nope, nope nope.<br /><br />the crotch buckle-<br />yup, I read about this in other reviews. I had put my kiddo in the seat in the store and figured- eh, I can adjust it and it will be fine! Wrong-O! They gave approximately 4cm of wiggle room in the belt... perhaps that is one of the ways they save costs on the seat??<br /><br />***This part isn't Graco's fault but if you're a parent and you don't realize this- you need to b/c I've seen/talked to people who don't know better and it freaks me out. Yes- this seat has a harness NO your 9 month old who can sit up or who is 20lb already should NOT use this seat yet! Should STILL BE IN REAR FACING. I've even heard/read people saying something about 6 mo olds. YIKES. NO!<br />And- the ""recline"" handle should read TILT- if your child is both old enough and big enough to use the forward facing seat they do not need to be reclined (adults aren't even supposed to ride reclined in the car) this tilting is to adjust the seat to your car peeps.<br /><br />In reading many many many of the reviews- I read some Britax haters. One commented that people that have Britax just like to throw around the name... First I was like really? Hmm, maybe so. Maybe I too am being a Britax snob. Maybe I don't need to spend the extra money....and Now- I tell them why Britax (or another better brand)... Because the Britax seats FAR surpass the quality and user friendliness of the Graco seats. Those that have used the bucking latch system that has release buttons to remove the seat and ***a strap on EITHER side of the seat to tighten it in***. This is important- because getting your seat in snug and tight is the whole point of a car seat. To keep your babies stable should anything happen.<br />Other brands have the same button release latches that self tighten now!!! YOu just latch, kneel/sit in the seat and push back and no tugging belts! yay!<br />SO- when looking at a seat- study the latch system, the clips across the chest- many of these things are better quality in the pricier seats. Some say- oh you're just paying for better fabric in those seats. Its not just the fabric.<br />You get what you pay for.

I am a twin mom that immediately purchased B-Safe carriers for my twins, the double B-Agile stroller, then when they turned 11 months old I purchased them both Pavilion 70-G3 convertible cowmooflage print car seats. I loved most everything about them until yesterday.<br />We went on a road trip over the weekend and one of my girls got a little car sick. We had cleaned it all up but I wanted to wash the entire cover when we returned home to ensure it was clean. When we removed the cover we found that the head restraint 'wings' were severely cracked, like nearly torn off. So we checked the other car seat immediately and found that both sides were completely broke off. This really stressed me out knowing my kids were just on a car trip in these seats and the totted safety features are completely broken.<br />I started calling Britax this morning and their phone number was temporarily unavailable. I finally got through this afternoon and was told my seats are outside of the 1 year warranty but that I could buy new wing pieces. I told her that the seats are minimally used, my toddlers do not fight getting into them and we have never had an accident. She informed me that they are made of the same foam that is in your cars bumper and are made to break. I said but this is less than normal wear causing them to break, not an accident. She told me the car seat was fine without them but that I would have to pay to replace them.<br />So if you are looking to buy a car seat and reviewing the extra safety features that make Britax sound like they are worth all that extra $$$$, think again. Those features are meant to break and may have never been keeping my children any more safe than the Chicco or Graco's. What a bunch of misleading marketing or a really great way to ensure they continue to suck money out of you from the constant purchase of replacement parts!<br />My children do not go in the car daily and sometimes only once per week.

I actually bought the Recaro Pro-Ride first.  When installed forward facing, it is a tank. You child will be protected.  My daughter, though, is not ready to ride forward-facing yet. So, I needed this to rear-face for a bit.  I could not get the Recaro to safely install in a rear-facing position in my Volvo XC90.  (See my review of the Recardo Pro-Ride for more info.)  I ended up returning the Recaro and getting the Britax Marathon 70-G3. This seat installed wonderfully in my car in the REAR facing position.  No noodle was needed.  It has a strap for the rear facing position that lets you connect the top of the seat to the floor of the car, which prevents tipping, which I really like.  It is nice and comfy and soft for the baby.  It has these plastic covers on the straps, that make it hard to get the straps tight if your baby is tiny, but you can get it to work.  I will say, though, that the Britax head proection is not as good as the Recaro.  Plus, the Recaro is deeper - your baby sits down in it more, so they are more protected from side impact.<br /><br />Bottom line for me:  This is a great seat for REAR facing.

We had to purchase a new seat for her now, because our second child is moving up into her old seat. Technically, our child meets the minimum requirements for a seatbelt booster now, but after reading a few discussion on this, it seems that with every seat &#34;upgrade&#34; (changing to forward-facing, then changing to seatbelt booster) you loose a layer of safety. In fact, even in our car manual it states that due to a child's anatomy, they recommend a 5-point harness until 5 years old (their skeleton isn't mature enough to &#34;properly&#34; handle a car accident if they are using a seatbelt booster this young).<br /><br />While safety was the biggest selling point for us to choose a convertible 5-point harness/seatbelt car seat, there are a few features that made this car seat stand out within this category. It is very nicely padded and the angle in the car is nice (not too steep or too upright), which makes for a comfortable ride. It's very easy to buckle, tighten, unbuckle, loosen and the straps don't tangle easily. This seat attaches to the latch system of the car, so it doesn't slide around when my 3-year-old climbs in the seat herself (this will be useful when we convert to the seatbelt function as well). As for any carseat that attaches via the latch system, you should check your car specs to see what the weight limit is for using a latch seat.<br /><br />I also love the colors — sleek and neutral but with a bit of custom stitching and hints of red that give some nice detail. My child loves the cup holders (I never knew she cared, but it's the first thing she noticed...) — they have an elastic band in the front which holds in the cup.<br /><br />The other seat we had ordered, but ended up returning is the &#34;Evenflo Chase LX Harnessed Booster, Jameson&#34; ([[ASIN:B016UJHJ8K Evenflo Chase LX Harnessed Booster, Jameson]]).

My sister recommended the Frontier 85, which she had bought.  After reviewing everything I could get my hands on, we purchased 2 of the Frontier 85's (Cowmooflage and Pink Sky).  Our daughter (4 years old, 42.5"" and 40lbs) loves the color's and I find the fabric very nice, not too keen on the gray on the bottom of the Pink Sky though, the feel of the fabric isn't nice.  At first they looked confusing to install, after reading the instructions twice, I had it in the Yukon in under 20 minutes, with my 4 year old's ""help"" and with the LATCH and tether.  Car seat back is nice and tight to the truck seat, tether is nice and tight, that car seat is not going anywhere.  Oh, and our Yukon has the captain's chairs NOT the bench.<br /><br />The car seats were shipped separately and arrived 4 days apart, so this morning we moved the one in the Yukon to the Ram and put the new one in the Yukon.  PIECE OF CAKE for the Ram, we can't use the tether due to the rear seat back not moving forward, but once the LATCH was tightened, that seat doesn't move an inch, and there is no gap between the bottom of the seat and the back of the trucks' seat.  I installed the new seat in the Yukon next.  Total time for both trucks 12 minutes.<br /><br />I was hesitant on the single pull LATCH tightening, but I LOVE IT.  I found it so much easier to get the seat tight, because you can't run out of strap to tighten, which was the problem I had with the Boulevard in the Yukon, I had it as tight as it would go, but is still had a little give.  The new LATCH is completely locked down, and once you feed the tightening strap through the slip, you get the angle you were always trying to get on the dual strap models, and it just locks the seat in.<br /><br />We found that even though this seat is bigger in size then the Boulevard, it fits better in the RAM.  The back of the car seat doesn't rest against the back window like the Boulevard, there is actually a 2-3 inch clearance.<br /><br />Our daughter loves the seats, they give her plenty of space, she loves the cup holders.  We love the extra padding Britax put on these seat, the lighter weight, the 5 point harness up to 85lbs was a huge selling point for us, and all the safety features and standards that Britax is known for.

3,2,0,0,3,Fits 3 Across,"Me: father of two, one rear-facing and one front-facing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* It is truly narrow, only slightly wider than a roll of paper towel<br />* The hip flaps cleverly expand to accommodate bigger kids and the seat base folds-up on mechanical hinge for travelling (handy for airport scanners, I suspect).<br />* It’s also built like a tank, the all-steel construction adds peace-of-mind. Even the head side cushions are super sturdy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* This thing weighs a ton. But as heavy as it is, it doesn’t even have any handles, so it feels even heavier. Despite the folding base, I would never take this on a plane on account of how heavy and awkward it is.<br />* Also, despite the fancy folding seats, this seat doesn’t even recline! Instead, it comes with a separate attachment (another thing to carry for travelling…) for rear-facing installation that just sort of props it up on one side, which is kind of like shoving a bunch of books underneath to tilt it. This is truly stupid for a $330 car seat. You can acquire their foam pad to shim the seat to different angles, but this doesn’t seem very tasteful to me and the pads are not even included in the box. I suppose anything could be as small as you want it to be, if it was infinitely disassembled into ""separate"" parts...<br />* Lastly, this seat leans sideways because of its slimness. I tend to position car seats nearer to the doors to widen the middle seat (the whole point of a slim seat is to salvage the middle seat, after all) and, while other wider child seats would just bridge over minor bumps in the car’s seat cushions, this seat’s narrowness makes it lean into those bumps, making it hard straighten. I suppose some shims would be helpful in this case to level the seat.<br /><br />If Diono is reading, here are my recommendations for the future:<br />* Handles or hand-slots for carrying<br />* If you have room for a folding base, you should find room for an articulating reclining mechanism. Otherwise, if both won’t fit, replace the folding base with a recline mech.<br />* If you still must keep the prop-up legs, make it collapsible under the seat instead being a separate attachment.<br />* Consider some kind of a lateral stabilizer like turn-out feet or a tilt-table base.

0,1,0,0,1,,"Seat works great.  Especially like the ""quick release"" LATCH connectors.  Our last seat just had the clips and it would take 10-15 minutes per clip to get them disconnected when we needed to move the seat.  These its just the push of a button just like a seat belt to get the connector loose (they are always out of reach of the child as well).  The shoulder height adjustment is good too.  You just twist a knob to slide the shoulder straps and side impact protection up and down to fit your kid.  The latch to loosen the straps is much better than our last seat as well.  Although, I saw a better designed one when we were looking that had a side mounted knob to loosen or tighten the straps.  The design on this seat is more of the conventional type with a pull strap in between the kids legs and a loosening latch just below the seat covers, but its operation is far better than average for the seats we tried out.  The only things that are kind of a bother are the weight of the seat and the lack of a good level indicator.  It's by far not the heaviest seat we saw, but it is still a bit heavy to move from vehicle to vehicle.  Also, the seat's only leveling indicator is a line on the side of the seat you are somehow supposed to step back and make sure it is parallel to the ground.  Our last seat had an actual level riveted to the side of the seat frame that was much easier and ""dummy proof"" on leveling the seat.

My husband and I were looking into the Britax and Recaro brand convertible carseats.  When we got the Recaro, it's a nice seat but when installed rear-facing in either a Toyota 4Runner or BMW 3-series wagon, it nearly blocks your ability to see through your back window.

1,2,0,0,0,Washable FabricCup HolderWashable FabricCup Holder,"When my daughter was close to outgrowing her car seat, we purchased this seat and the Graco Nautilus to see which one was better for us.  The Britax Frontier, in my opinion, is a higher quality and more desirable seat.<br /><br />The biggest thing that stood out immediately when we were adjusting the straps in both seats was that my daughter, who was 2 at the time, already needed the bottom strap with the buckle to be set in the last slot to be a comfortable fit for her in the Graco seat.  In the Britax seat, we only needed to put the buckle in the 2nd slot, with plenty of room to grow.  I knew I wanted to leave her in the harness as long as possible instead of switching her to the booster as soon as she hits the minimum weight, as many parents do.  Since she was already in the last slot at age 2, I am sure that she would've ended up sitting on the strap instead of having it come down just in front of her as it should.  I know this wouldn't be comfortable if the straps were tightened appropriately and it really doesn't seem all that safe.<br /><br />The next advantage of the Britax seat vs the Graco seat was the method to adjust the height of the harness shoulder straps.  In the Britax seat, you just push a button on the back of the seat and pull the headrest up.  On the Graco seat, you have to completely unthread the harness straps and rethread them in the higher slot.  This isn't really hard, admittedly, but it is a pain in the butt and Britax's system is so much easier.<br /><br />The installation of the Britax seat is not as easy as that of the Graco.  The angle of the belt path and the LATCH system buckle is awkward.  What I've found works is actually getting into the car, putting a knee in the seat and using my weight to push the seat tightly against my car seat while I tighten the straps.  This is the only way I've been able to get a really secure fit.  I cannot pull the straps tight enough to keep the seat from wiggling more than the recommended 1"" without using my weight to push the seat down first.  I drive a full sized SUV so I have plenty room to do this but it might be pretty awkward in a smaller vehicle.<br /><br />The cupholders on the Frontier are fantastic.  It is so nice to have one for a drink and one extra for a snack, or a toy, or whatever.  Really, it seems like a small thing but it does make a big difference.  I often bring along an extra small cup to hold snacks neatly in the cupholder.  A snack in a cup in a cupholder is much, much less messy in a car than a snack held in a small child's lap.  The Nautilus had some very cool secret compartments in the arm rests that my daughter really loved but I, personally, prefer the functionality of the cupholders.<br /><br />The HUGS system that holds the chest straps in place seems pretty gimmicky to me.  I don't think that they help all that much.  I still have to adjust the chest buckle every time I buckle my daughter in and it is kind of annoying to have to adjust the HUGS thing, too.  I also accidentally pinched the skin on my daughter's neck when it got caught between the firm plastic HUGS system and the strap as I adjusted it up.  It wasn't a serious injury but it made her cry and it has made me resent HUGS even more.  The padding around the straps to protect the neck, on the other hand, are great.  They stay in place, are very soft, and my daughter has never complained about being uncomfortable.<br /><br />You do have to remove the straps completely to remove the covers on both seats so there was really no advantage either way in this category.  Since purchasing the seat, I've started using the Summer Infant Deluxe Piddle Pad.  It is easy to remove and clean that pad instead of the whole seat and it was fantastic when we were still potty training.  Even though we haven't had a potty accident in the car in quite some time, we still use the pad in case of occasional food or drink spills.<br /><br />We've had the seat now for about 6 months.  It still looks brand new.  We've actually purchased a second seat just like it for the other car.  The Graco Nautilus went back to the store.",785,Yes,"Harness Type: adjusting the straps; method to adjust the height of the harness shoulder straps; push a button on the back of the seat and pull the headrest up; HUGS system that holds the chest straps in place; padding around the straps to protect the neck

I've had another kind of seat, and just no. It's for emergencies only. I'm very thankful for the addition of the safewash fabric. This was not available when I had my first. I definitely recommend buying the liner, too. Crumbs collect in the bottom, under the clicktight lid, and cleaning under there is a major pain. Also, this is a pretty large seat.

I can sit inbetween, so there is room for a smaller adult or child, but it's not somewhere I would want to ride for a long period of time.

Being 5ft 5 inches I can drive comfortably but it's a different story for my 6ft 1in husband. He drives a Jeep Grand Cherokee and we find that he has the legroom issue in it, as well.

Easy for adults, but my three year old has not figured out how to get out of this one.<br />- Easy to install and very light weight. No base to adjust.

Nice and narrow.<br />- Child sits deep in the seat. I feel like this one provides a lot of side impact protection.

0,1,0,0,0,,"We purchased the Graco ComfortSport at Target in Sept of 2010 as an emergency replacement for our previous carseat after an accident. (We actually got the Creighton model.) I have 3 major concerns about the safety of this seat:<br /><br />1) The shoulder straps do not tighten evenly. After looking at the back of the seat I realized this is due to the design of the set yoke; most seats have two individual hooks for the shoulder belts, tightened by a single pull strap. The ComfortSport overlaps the two shoulder straps under a single hook and one strap will always be a little looser than the other. This also crates the potential for the overlapping strap to slip out of the hook, as it is barely held in place by the hook.<br /><br />2) The chest plate is easy to unbuckle, even for young children. I looked up advice on how to solve this issue on Graco's website- apparently many parents were having the same issues and Graco's response was that parents should just explain to their children why they need to keep the belt on. After pulling over 10+ times on a two-hour trip because my 2 year old didn't understand my explaining on why this belt was intended to keep him safe, I settled on buying self-adhesive Ace wrap to wrap around the buckle so he couldn't mess with it.<br /><br />3) The tightening plate on our model broke after only 11 months of use. I was tightening the strap, as usuall, and the single screw the holds the plate in place pulled out and flew somewhere in the car. If this had happened during an accident, the shoulder straps would have been loosened about 2 inches and greatly reduced the protection of the seat.<br /><br />I had contaceted Graco regauding my concerns about the seat, and asking for a refund. They sent me a letter stating that if I had problems with their product, I should ship it to them at MY expense and they would replace the seat with another one of the same model- no refund. Needless to say I just went out and bought a different, better rated seat for my son.",368,Yes,"Harness Type: shoulder straps do not tighten evenly; overlapping strap under a single hook; shoulder straps would have been loosened

0,2,1,0,5,,"Overall this car seat gets the job done. I previously had a Chicco and chose this carseat because it's the lightest carseat around and I loved the the color options. My review is mostly comparing the two.<br /><br />Pros: It's light.<br /><br />It's good looking.<br /><br />Snaps easily in and out of the base.<br /><br />Cons: It's very long. Whoever sits in front of this car seat has an uncomfortable ride because they will have to pull their seat so far forward.<br /><br />It's awkward and uncomfortable to carry. There's no padding on the handle and it's hard to carry for longer than a run from the parking lot to the cart.<br /><br />The canopy doesn't move easily, is floppy, and sometimes gets in the way of locking it into the base. Due to the stiffness in moving it I am now the proud owner of a replacement because the canopy hub cracked and wouldn't hold the canopy up.<br /><br />The strap to tighten or loosen the harness is also awkward. You push it down, but to get good leverage on it you end up holding down the very strap that you are trying to loosen. On that note, it's also difficult to tighten.<br /><br />When I called for a replacement part for the canopy I was told that there is no replacement but since it was still under warranty I'd get a replacement. Cool. In order to get a replacement I needed to send in 5&#34; of the safety strap, a 5&#34; square of the pad, and the serial sticker and once they received those they would send me the new seat. Wait, what? You don't have a second car seat? Then they charge you a hefty deposit that they will refund once they receive those items from you. Seems slightly wasteful to destroy a perfectly good car seat that has a cracked canopy hub.<br /><br />If I had to choose a carseat all over again I'd go back to the Chicco (which is only 1lb heavier) for ease of use, functionality, and ability to fit in our vehicles (out of our Pontiac G6, Chevy Avalanche, and an old Mercedes we all fit comfortably in none if them).

It does not have a removable cover at all, only the headrest from what I read so that is a downside. The cost with the accessories is $500.

0,1,0,0,5,,"I love this car seat. I am an avid researcher and also work within a reasonable budget. I have an average sized sedan, but it sadly does not accommodate all car seats. I had the Britax B-Safe, and it was a snug fit for any passengers, and any front seat passenger could only recline the seat so far. Rather than buying a car to fit a seat, I figured there will be more options for the convertible car seats. Wrong. I tried every. single. one. at Babies R Us, to zero avail. I was trying to stick within a less than $200 budget so as much as I drooled over the NextFit it was too pricey ($299.99 at BRU).<br />When I did the test fit, it was considerably comfortable. It is much narrower in the base compared to other convertible car seats. It has multiple recline positions so if you're fitting it in a small car rear-facing, you can adjust it so your baby is safe but the front passengers can also be comfortable. Also, the overall height of the seat isn't ridiculous. For people not in an SUV- other convertible car seats literally were touching the roof of my car (ie all the Safety 1st brands!) They are so tall, I literally fit in them. This seat has a great adjustable head rest so by the time my child is tall enough to fully extend it  she will be forward facing and it will blend into the car's headrest but while smaller and rear facing it has a lower height profile.<br />I am only 5'3 and 100lbs, so getting straps tight has always been a downfall. With a husband deployed, I was honestly really nervous it would be a nightmare. Using LATCH, with the classic style strap to tighten plus the come-along style pulley, I was able to get it so tight it doesn't budge. I do recommend for those with leather, you put non-slip underneath! The straps can extend pretty long, so you wont have issues reaching your LATCH system (the Britax were just barely long enough even in my small car).<br />My daughter loves her new seat, she can see much more out the windows and its comfortable as far as I can tell.

My second child will be in need in of a convertible seat soon and I will not be buying a second NextFit.  While it does the job and is a solid and good seat, there are enough irritants with it that are causing me to pass a second time.<br /><br />- It is HEAVY. Changing cars is almost unbearable and my parents refuse to do it because it is too heavy for them.  It is very awkward getting it into the back of sedan like vehicles, all around a massive pain to move.  If you NEVER or very rarely change it out this might not be a huge factor for you, but it is a bear.<br /><br />- When rear facing, it can be really hard to tighten the straps because it is SO close to the seat.  This might be the case with other car seats too, but my parents especially complain a lot.  I can do it, but I don't love it and I have to use a lot of force. Which leads to the next issue.<br /><br />- My current seat is actually a replacement from Chicco (INCREDIBLE customer service) because the plastic casing around the orange button to loosen the straps kept popping out and eventually the plastic broke because to tighten the straps you have to pull up instead of at the same angle as the strap given how close the strap is to the seat.  (kinda hard to explain)  Well this same issue has happened on my current seat.  I cannot tell you how annoying it is trying to tighten the straps and the whole plastic bit pops off.<br /><br />- The button to raise and lower the headrest which also adjusts the straps seems a little flimsy.  Every now and then when my 3.5 yr old gets into the seat I notice that the headrest has gone back down.  It takes a bit of wiggling and jiggling to get it lock again at the correct height.<br /><br />- It's hot.  The seat doesn't breath well. It's really cushiony which is nice, but at the cost of being hot. Fortunately my daughter doesn't overheat too much, but my son always is really hot in his carseats, so this seat definitely won't work for him.<br /><br />- Even with the strap covers, my daughter gets lines and irritants in her neck.  Maybe I'm overzealous in my tightening, but I do feel bad after a long ride and I see her neck.<br /><br />- All the inclines seem kind of a waste.  I can only have the seat included at 1 or 2 rear facing for it to be in the correct level.  Any other inclines take the seat out of the level area.  Not sure about forward facing as I haven't switched around to that yet.<br /><br />All the pros that people mention are true, but for the above reasons I won't get another one.",512,Yes,"Seat Type: Rear Facing, Forward Facing, Convertible

The rear facing fit with the seatbelt, on the corolla, is extremely tight. The fabric feels nice and the light green color insures my son won't get as hot in the summer.

1,1,0,0,0,Removable Seat Cushion,"We just purchased the boulevard g4 in Laguna, and this is the fourth Britax seat we own. Currently, we have another boulevard, a frontier and a parkway sgl. I love them, and I will never buy anything other than Britax. Since my oldest was born 10 years ago, I have gone through numerous graco, evenflo, safety 1st and Eddie Bauer seats, that were all junk compared to Britax. I thought all car seats were crappy, and I would just have to deal with them. That is, until I bought my first Britax 5 years ago. Since then, I have done my research on car seat safety, and I personally would never trust a cheap seat again.<br /><br />The boulevard has many great features. My favorite is the separate latch straps. I get a tight fit every time, and no need to untwist straps threaded through the seat. The easy adjustable headrest, removable cover without unthreading the harness, headwings, hugs, safe cell technology, steel reinforcement and tether that can be used rear facing- all wonderful! Not only great in safety, but also convenience.<br /><br />There is only one con I can come up with, on this pattern.  This would never, ever deter me from buying a Britax.<br />The material: It is so strange to me, how every pattern that Britax offers, varies in material. Some of them are all velvet/microfiber/plush, some are nylon, some are cotton etc. The Laguna blue color is a cotton material, so it doesn't seem as though it will clean up easily. It seems as though it will absorb any dirt or spills. Also, the black trim is a harder, scratchy material. So that is found on the headwings, infant pillow and strap covers. Now, it does not bother me enough to exchange it. I prefer color on the seats, and this is currently the only color offered. But, I own another boulevard, that is made of a plush material, and it just seems logical to offer a softer material on the head. It doesn't bother the baby at all though, so I don't think it's a huge deal. The only part that bothers me, is the shoulder strap covers. Since they are harder, they don't bend as easily and seem as snug as the other ones I have. The other two seats I own (boulevard and frontier) came in different materials and are a much better fit. And my other boulevard, frontier and parkway all are made of a different material in the middle. That material is easier to clean, and seems more repellant.<br /><br />So, if buying this again, I would still purchase the Laguna pattern. But if they offered Laguna in the same material as sterling or onyx? I would choose that option. I just don't know why Britax can't be consistent with their material. Oh well! Their seats more than make up for their material choice. I just wanted to point out the material on the Laguna, in case someone would want to know. I look to these reviews, when making a purchase that I can't see in person.",516,Yes,"Material: The Laguna blue color is a cotton material, so it doesn't seem as though it will clean up easily.

My granddaughter isn’t with me everyday but spends enough time with me that I need a car seat in my own car every day. When she was infant I used a Chico infant seat for her . It was fantastic and I really thought I’d purchase another Chico when she was ready for a bigger seat.<br />All my research led me to Britax and the Advocate. I wanted the safest seat I could get for her. I am not very handy, so I needed something easy too. The ClickTight sounded pretty perfect. So I decided to go with the Britax Advocate ClickTight, after reading every review I could find.<br />Let me say it is a heavy seat and I don’t like to move it around.

My only problem getting baby in seat has been when she’s being playful and won’t sit still so I can buckle her.<br />It does take two hands to fasten and unfasten the belts on her seat but that just keeps her safer, in my opinion- meaning she can’t get out by herself.<br />I’ve washed the cover and replaced it on seat.

0,2,0,0,2,,"I’m going to try my best to explain this...but here is my review on the Safety 1st Jive Convertible car seat.<br /><br />I purchased this car seat to put in my moms truck as a rear facing car seat until Posey is flipped front facing. I installed it in my car to begin with so I could make sure it was set up properly and ready to go before we made our trip to North Dakota. I noticed there was a slight issue when I put it in my car but figured it was because I did it quick. So I took it to my moms and installed it in her truck for the trip. Thought all was good and we started our journey. We stopped to get gas the first time and noticed Posey was leaning further back and the level line was no longer level to the ground. Figured I did it wrong again and just reinstalled the seat and continued going. Stopped for gas again and the seat was leaning backwards again. So again I adjusted it and went about our way. When we made it to our destination I made a comment to my mom that the seat just wasn’t securing the right way. Pulled the book out and made sure I did everything as it states and I had. So we just went about our trip. Then we moved the kids seats from my moms truck to my sisters truck and I could not for the life of me get it to sit properly rear faced. So I turned her front facing against my own judgement because it was secure and felt safer then putting her in it rear facing. I felt better about it if she sat front facing then rear at this point because clearly something was off with the seat. We went to leave and head back to California and I installed it in my moms truck again and it just wouldn’t secure right. So I rolled up a blanket and put it underneath it hoping that would help. And it didn’t... so we put her front facing again which in turn caused her to get carsick and vomit all over. So I rolled those blankets back up and flipped her back around and drove home. I wrote the company an email about my concerns and hadn’t heard back. But it just wasn’t sitting well with me. So I called them today and they pulled my email up and spent 30 minutes FaceTiming me to ensure that I was installing the seat correctly. Which I was. They called another employee in to watch me install and tighten the seat into the car. I showed them how easily it pushes backwards and how she would wind up laying on her back just about in the car. They told me the seat isn’t compatible with my car. I told them I have installed this specific seat in not one, but three different vehicles and it does it in all three. They said that it must not be compatible with any of them. I looked on their website to find a compatible car seat list and couldn’t find one. Also read reviews on amazon and their website stating the same issue I’m having. They ended up issuing me a refund and having me destroy this seat and will ‘look into’ others to see if they are having the same issue. I’m not sure how I feel about that but I hope this post sways some people on purchasing this and saves a babies life. Because even the lady on the phone from the company said the seat should not push backwards so far that the baby is laying on their back. Your child should not be able to push their feet on the back seat and move the car seat backwards. Ever. And that was the point I was trying to prove to them. I’m not sure if they even believe me.

Super comfy for my daughter and I feel that she is really well-protected.<br /><br />Quick tip regarding the click-tight, which I didn't feel was clear in the manual: don't over-tighten the seat belt or latch belt!<br /><br />If you are coming from any other type of seat, you're probably used to threading the belt and then pulling as hard as possible to get that sucker tight enough.  The way the ClickTight is designed to work, is the frame puts extra pressure on the belt as it closes, creating that tension for you.  The first time I tried to install, I saw right away why other reviewers have had issues with getting the seat to open back up again (even having to resort to pliers).  If the belt is too tight, you have to force the seat closed and then it is nearly impossible to open again.  What worked best for me was to just thread the belt through, removing any slack but not pulling it taut.  Then close the seat - it should close with one firm push, you shouldn't have to force it - if you're struggling, try actually LOOSENING the belt a little.  Once closed, THEN do the wiggle test and hopefully it should be rock solid.  I'm really satisfied with the system, and hope that tip helps other people like it better, too!",237,Yes,"Installation Type: ClickTight, seat belt, latch belt, threading the belt, pulling to tighten, belt too tight, loosen the belt, wiggle test","The car seat should be easy to install using a ClickTight system.

It's easy to adjust the back so the straps can grow with her, as those grey plastic twist things control the height.  The removable cup holder is a godsend.<br /><br />A BIG issue that pops up occasionally is that the straps can sometimes get stuck when trying to tighten.  As in, they just don't tighten anymore and it's still loose on my daughter.  It seems to happen more when the tightening strap is pulled up (which is how we tighten our other Safety 1st), but it's also just hard to tighten properly in general.  I'm glad I didn't have this seat when my daughter was really small, as I can't imagine struggling to get it tight enough.

Thus ensued major frustration from my 7yo and myself, trying to get the seatbelt out of the belt clip. As soon as I expanded it, we got the belt and my child out easily. I will be sending that one back, hopefully to get a non-defective one in return. This is a very easy quality-control test that clearly wasn't performed.

0,2,0,1,0,,"This is the coolest car seat we have ever owned, and we have owned a lot.  The only thing this doesn’t have is tech running through it.  The instruction booklet is a must and thankfully, this car seat does have a tray located at the base to store the booklet! For when you need to make adjustments, remove the seat, etc.  Also, this isn’t just for you, this is great for the friend, other parent, grandparent etc. that is helping you and may have no idea how this seat works.<br /><br />I am sure some people are questioning my sanity about this trivial thing; but until you are sitting in a parking lot crying because you can’t figure out how to release the car seat from a locking base you will never understand my excitement of this feature.  (Yes, that is a true story. )<br /><br />The seat cover can be completely removed to wash.  I have not had to remove my cover to wash it I have only used wash rags/ wipes to clean up spills.  The side panels feel almost like canvas but with a coating on them.  While the inside portion (where child sits) of the car seat is covered in a non-abrasive material that is a squishy (feel like memory foam) padding.<br /><br />There are two removable head pillows, and a lumbar support / booster.  I really wish my vehicle had this little thing.  The belts expand with a simple push of the button located in the front of the seat, and then gently pull the harness straps.  If you loosen too much pull the sing strap at the base to tighten.  You can do this one handed.<br /><br />There is a recline feature on the seat.  To engage it once you pull a ‘trigger leaver’ at the bottom of the car seat, it is located in the front (where ankles would sit when taller) just pull forward and seat reclines.  Again, this can be done one handed.<br /><br />The car seat clamps to the vehicle metal U rings located in the back seat area, in addition it uses the seat belt to keep the seat stable & secure.  When you first take the seat out of the box the clamps are already attached but tucked up under the outer sides for storage.  At first, I thought these clamps were broken because when you press the release (red) button on them nothing happens; however when hooking them on you hold them like a Taser and push them onto the metal bars of the U rings until you hear them click.  These will not disconnect unless you hold the red button, just like a seat belt, but you have to pull away from the ring while the button is engaged.<br /><br />The cup holders lock into place, they are somewhat small but do hold a bottle securely unlike other holders. Larger sippy cups may not fit, I recommend checking yours first.  You can remove them, to make the holder area bigger and for cleaning.  You can run them through a dishwasher.<br /><br />Overall this car seat looks and feels like it should be in a space shuttle, it’s very sturdy and not excessively heavy.  It isn’t the removable kind you can use in a stroller but if you are looking to buy 1 seat that will grow with your child I believe this is it.

It installed just fine in my small car in a matter of minutes.

I tried to keep my 4 year old in a 5 point harness as long as possible but finally he kept telling me his buckle was &#34;hurting his penis&#34;. I knew at that time, it was time to upgrade! This booster looks great, feels super sturdy and is easy to assemble. The pieces basically just snap together. Not long after I bought this seat my son was in the back seat of my mom's mustang and was rear ended. The car was totaled, but luckily everyone was ok! I love this booster seat and I'd love to credit my son's safety to it. A key part of this I believe is the seat belt guides that properly put the seatbelt across the shoulder position. The seat wipes down easy and the cupholders are a plus. Today, I actually bought a second one of these boosters in red from Toys 'R' Us for $39.99 for our other vehicle.

That was the 5 point harness seat that was used from age 2 until 4. After only 2 years of use it seemed like it was falling apart. The interior styrofoam seemed to detach itself from the plastic and the cloth seat was forever coming undone. It also was so large, bulky and heavy it was a pain to take out and move if needed be. My younger son also had a newer Britax Boulevard which practically fell apart as well. We did take off the cloth cover to wash a few times, but with putting it back on a piece of the styrofoam interior ripped off and eventually the whole styrofoam liner started detaching itself again. I ended up throwing out the Boulevard, then giving my younger child the Marathon, and we finally got rid of that and he is in a Evenflo Maestro. I now have 2 Evenflo Maestro's!

My 30-month, 30-pound son is very comfy, and it's super easy to adjust around his clothing, etc.  NOTE: I don't recommend putting it together in a parking lot at 11PM in winter, as it takes some time to assemble and is hard to do with cold fingers :)<br /><br />UPDATE 9/24/10: I have to knock this down a star now that my kid has grown some more.  We had to remove him from the 5-point harness just before his 5th birthday, even though he's only about 44lbs.  The crotch strap on this is TOO CLOSE to the back of the seat.  So when we buckle him in 5-point, it smushes his 'stuff' and makes him uncomfortable for the whole ride. It became so much of an issue that we had to discontinue use of the harness and go to the belt.  The whole reason I got this was for the high-weight limit on the 5-pt.  In addition, it's VERY hard to clean.  Easy enough to get the pads off and wash, etc, but when you disassemble it there are a ton of little crevices that are filled with nasty stuff (cracker crumbs, raisins, you name it) that is SO hard to get out!  It's at 4 stars (down from 5) due mainly to the crotch strap issue, though...but still very comfy and easy to buckle into.",317,Yes,"Seat Type: Convertible

It's super slim, so it almost fits 3 across, but even in the van I would struggle to go three. It has two and would be a tight fit on three for me. The lack of a base just caused a headache. I have a newer 2019 Chevy Equinox, as well as a 2013 minivan and it is not working in either vehicle. I thought that I'd give it a go in my Dad's 05 Silverado and see if it was just something with the way the seats were in my car, versus perhaps and older vehicle and it still didn't work correctly.<br /><br />I followed all of the instructions, watched videos, and even resorted to taking it to the fire house for a check. The seat just does not want to stay on the level line. My niece is only 23 lbs, well within the range of the 5-40 lbs recommended for the rear facing option. I worked with the firehouse to get it level and then put her in it. I did a few test laps out back and sure enough, after a few bumps and driving around the building, when I'd get out the level line would be off. It has a suggestion in the booklet about using a towel or rolled up blanket, but that still didn't fix the issue.<br /><br />The seat is cute, and it does work when flipped around, though. I tested it out forward facing and it stays where it should and is leveled out. It's kind of frustrating after going through all the steps. What I ultimately decided to do was take my nephews EvenFlow convertible seat and flip it to rear facing for my niece and then flipped this one forward for my nephew. He doesn't seem to mind the Miney seat and once they're both big enough, I can flip the seats back around and use this for my nieces seat. It's just been a process and I cannot recommend this in good conscience as a rear facing seat. It was a hassle. I hope I explained it well enough and that someone finds this helpful.<br /><br />To it's positive, the clips on this are easy to adjust. The design is great. It is cushioned and well padded on the sides. The dual cup holders are awesome for taking sippy cups and drinks along without spills.

I had issues in the past with my babies fussing in other seats because they were hard and uncomfortable.  So I appreciate the extra comfort.  With that, I anticipate this seat to hold heat tho.<br /><br />One handed handle operation.  This is a great feature.  All too many times, mamas are holding a sleeping baby and trying to transfer to a car seat, only to find the handle forward as we juggle holding baby and trying to get a handle back with 2 hands.  The one handed operation is a timesaver. I've played with it enough that I dont foresee a problem accidently moving the handle.<br /><br />Adjustable crotch snap.  This feature is wonderful for a growing baby.  Too many carseats have the buckle set in one place and lil babies are slouching and bigger babies are pinched.  So to be able to move closer/further away with growth is a great security and comfort factor.<br /><br />No puzzle lock.  OMG...who's idea was that anyway?  I detest puzzle locks.  This one buckles in, straight, from each side without having to twist and turn the 2 buckles  together before inserting into the latch.<br /><br />The headrest and buckles seem to be easy to move.

Material and workmanship both seem very nice and honestly we wouldn't be concerned about carrying our daughter around in it now that she's a year and a half old.<br /><br />We weren't thrilled with other aspects of the seat.

Other reviewers said it was on the heavy side...not too bad for me since it only stays in one of our cars.  I love the soft fabric (velvet like).  I was very drawn to the outstanding saftey reviews on this particular car seat.  So far it's been really easy to use. Adjustments are done in seconds.  Only took me a few minutes to install it in my car.  It seems very sturdy and doesn't move at all when I try to push on it.  I bought this for my 10 month old daughter who just outgrew her first car seat  So far she seems very happy and comfortable in it.  I also like how this will last us into the booster seat stage.  It's a pricey investment, but for overall safety it's worth it.  ***This was also MUCH more expensive at the retail stores (some were $100 more expensive).

Bought from Target.<br /><br />Likes:<br />1.  Cushioning/styling is very nice.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />1. The belts do not slide very well through the slide points.  This includes the cinch to take slack out of/put slack in the harness and ESPECIALLY the latch system whether tightening or loosening.  These should work with minimal resistance, not be near impossible to pull (it’s like the release button didn’t work at all).<br />2. The way the seat is balanced in the rear facing direction.  The latch system Doesn’t seem to be properly positioned, which causes the seat to not be stable enough to stay in one place.  Even with both the latch system and the shoulder belt threaded through there, the bottom rear of the seat (car forward) is rounded and will fall with weight added to the seat back.  If you couple this with number one, 2 very seemingly unsafe things will happen (look at the picture): the seat will lay down, as the bottom of the seat starts to ride up the car seat back, and the seat will sway from side to side.  I tried sitting all 260 lbs of me onto the car seat to get it to go down as far as possible, then tried securing the latch belt as best I could and the thing lasted 2 days in this position and by the third day started to fall/slide.<br />3. The seat is difficult to adjust.  You have to pull out the seat bottom (booster) completely and make your adjustments, then thread both the latch system AND harness back into the seat bottom, which, for me, a 21 year technician took three hands to do well.  A few times I’d get 3/4 belts seated properly, only to have the booster not seat properly back into the seat back, or one got caught in a pinch point and I had to do the thing all over again.<br />4. The price for what it is.  Look, it’s a lot of molded plastic and well padded cushions and at first glance it looks like it should be worth what they’re asking, but when you take into account all the problems I had with it, it didn’t do near as well as the $219 Graco I exchanged it for.  Night and day difference.  Granted, the Graco doesn’t “look” as nice as this one, but the user friendliness of the evenflo is atrocious.<br /><br />With all the other positive reviews I wonder if  I got a bad apple.  I wonder if the system that tightened up the belts needed some lubrication or something, but the design flaws are there molded right into the plastic.  I’m happy I got my money back and that the Graco was so much better.  I’m not being paid by any company, I just hope some guy doesn’t make the same mistake I did.

The rigid latch will secure it to your car, rock solid, even preventing side to side wiggle.  And it's narrow, so you can actually get to the seat belt latch.  The upper part where the belt goes through is also the best design so far, so the belt can't come out  and believe it or not, the ""recline"" feature actually works.  And works well.  This is quality Italian engineering and you get what you pay for.  Ive confirmed to fit across several BMWs (X3, 5 serie, M3) which are notoriously challenging with latch and rear space, so this should work in any car.  And yes, it's price is outrageous.

This was a great, inexpensive (comparatively) option that we feel confident with to keep our child safe.<br />We have a Toyota Camry and because we’re both so tall, our seats are pushed all the way back. This car seat almost fit behind the passenger seat. If we moved the seat up an inch or so, it would fit easily behind the passenger.

We use this for our eldest, who at 10 is about to graduate from boosters altogether. He began using it at about age 7. We don't need height from a booster for him, just the shoulder belt positioner. The seat belts in our backseat are really high, so he still needs that feature for now. I recommend this seat for older, bigger, mature kids who don't need seat height or a reminder to sit right, just a better fit to the lap and/or shoulder seat belts. It's also great for difficult three-across installations, travel, and carpools.<br /><br />I think they may have fixed this since we bought ours, but we do find the lap belt guides tricky to thread.

As the reviews state it is very fancy looking which is what drew us to it but the MOST important thing is 1- your baby's comfort and 2- functionality.  This seat is very tight and deep so it is not comfortable for the baby once they grow beyond a newborn size and we ended up buying a new seat when he was 6 months because both our son and my husband and I hated this seat.  From a functionality standpoint, because of the size of the seat it was extremely hard to put even a very tiny baby in and out of the seat which was brutal for me.  Everything was so difficult to attach and click in<br /><br />Maxi Cosi also sells an adaptor kit to attach this seat to an uppa baby stroller.  When you attach it to the stroller the seat leans forward so the babys head flops forward and given newborns sleep all the time this made the attachment to that stroller unusable.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this car seat to anyone.

When I received the car seat it had no shoulder strap covers as it was pictured on the one I bought. It came in no plastic covering, just in a box. The fabric stains very easy and the cover is a pain to pull off.

I work in law enforcement and their father is in EMS so unfortunately, we are exposed to how tragic traffic collisions can become without the proper child restraints. I am hoping to become certified in the next few weeks as a CPST. With my research, I discovered that the key is a proper installation and because of this, I decided that I would buy a separate seat for each of my 2 children in each of the cars we routinely drive as well as their grandparent's vehicle. For my son who is 3.5 years old, I have owned several seats ranging from a basic Cosco front facing seat to Graco convertibles to Britax convertibles. My daughter is 7 months old and recently began to outgrow her Peg Perego infant seat. I decided to begin transitioning her to this seat in my primary vehicle and plan to purchase a couple more convertible car seats for the other vehicles over the next couple of months. I could not be happier. She is in the middle seat of my 2015 Nissan Pathfinder so I had to use a seat belt installation instead of LATCH. This made me super nervous as I was concerned about getting a secure seatbelt install, but the click tight technology has been very user friendly. She seems to be very content in the seat and a good fit. I'm not sure if budget will allow us to purchase multiple of this particular model of Britax, but I do think it was worth every penny in our primary vehicle and will be researching other similar seats thoroughly for the other seats she needs.",296,Yes,"Seat Type: Convertible

My husband and I tried to install it in the backseat of my four door Honda Civic one night after putting our son to bed. We read the directions and used a rolled up towel to try and get the right level on the seats. My car has the latch system, but we just couldn't get the strap to pull tightly enough to keep the seat from wiggling significantly. After almost an hour, we gave up and put his old seat base back in. My husband called one of his friends (with two kids a bit older than ours, so he's an experienced car seat installer) to come over the next night. It took too grown men about half an hour of tugging, pulling and pushing to finally get the seat installed tight enough for us to feel our son would be safe sitting in it.<br /><br />Also, once installed rear facing the seat's tilt can't be adjusted, so make sure you have it set to the recline level you want before installing it rear facing. I wouldn't recommend this for an infant, because I don't think it reclines enough for a baby that can't support it's own head, even with the insert. (Unless you have miraculously flat back seats.) We have it on the most reclined position, but even with a towel the tilt of my rear seats makes it so that it's sitting almost upright.  Once installed, I've had no problems with the seat. It's very easy to adjust the height of the shoulder straps and to tighten and loosen the straps. Also, this seat allows the front passenger seat to go back farther than our previous infant car seat. I'd recommend getting a seat cover, to protect against any puking, accidents, or food spills, because trying to clean the seat itself is a nightmare.

1,2,1,1,0,,"Overall, I think this seat is great and I'd recommend it. There are parts about this seat that I really love and other parts that are frustrating - things that could easily be changed to make this seat awesome!!  This seat is way too innovative and good to make it only an occasional-use / folding / &#34;grab-and-go&#34; seat.  I believe the inventor should re-think the seat and make it a regular-use seat that focuses on ease-of-use instead of the folding & traveling aspects.  What do I mean?<br /><br />1.  Well, we've been using this as our primary seat for our 6-year-old so we leave it permanently &#34;installed.&#34;  The word installed isn't exactly accurate since the seat isn't strapped down & latched the way a baby's car seat would be.  Instead, this seat sits on the regular seat of the car & uses the seatbelt each time - but...  we've been leaving the shoulder-belt strap guide always attached to the belt and the right-side of the lap belt always stays in the right lap-belt guide (the shoulder part of our seatbelt comes over our daughter's right shoulder and the seatbelt buckles next to her left hip). The problem comes when the seat slides back and folds up each time she gets out.  So, everytime she gets back in the car, she needs to reposition the seat and get it to sit flat while the shoulder strap is pulling slightly upward, making the seat fold. Also, as little kids do, she sits down on the edge of the seat and then wiggles herself backward and onto the seat.  This also pushes the seat back and into a semi-folded position that she needs to flatten under herself.<br />What do I suggest?  Make the seat non-folding...  or at least offer a non-folding version... or create a locking mechanism to keep it open & flat.  The folding aspect is cute but only necessary when you need to toss it in a backpack or store it somewhere small.  However, for regular use the whole seat is tiny already, even when it's open / flat.<br /><br />2.  Next issue is something a couple of other reviewers pointed out - the lap-belt guides slide inward way too easily but require you to unlock them with a tab to slide them outwards.  Also, that locking mechanism tab is underneath the seat so that it can't be easily released without standing the child back up.  This seems silly to me - the lap-belt guides get bumped into easily when sliding the lap belt into them and when other kids in the car are shifting around.  I think that the lap-belt guides should be locking in both directions and prefer the locking tab to be accessible (if possible) from the top.  Again, if we're thinking of a regular-use seat that doesn't need to easily fold up for travel, then we can re-imagine the lap-belt guides a tad.  Maybe there's some adjustment that could be made to keep the lap belt in proper position in the right belt guide (in my scenario) so that when she gets back into the seat it won't require a whole repositioning?<br /><br />3.  The shoulder-belt guide strap - as I said above, we always leave this attached. However, when you take off the belt the shoulder-belt strap guide (that red plastic piece) just slides down and needs to be repositioned the next time our daughter gets back in.  What I've been doing is inserting a section of the strap into the guide as a second layer inside the guide along with the shoulder belt.  This keeps the clip of the plastic guide from slipping downward.  However, again, if we re-imagine this seat as a regular-use, non-traveling seat, then maybe we can come up with something better to keep the guide from sliding down or requiring any repositioning each time the child gets back in?<br /><br />Enough about my suggested changes...  What do I really like about this seat?<br />I love that this seat is so compact - not a bulky thing that makes it absolutely impossible to fit 3 boosters or combination of boosters and baby car seats in a row!!!  Our daughter has a small body that didn't require a huge area but all of the other boosters were fixed with wide seats that took up essential room for no reason.  Before this seat, the booster barely squeezed into place and made buckling the seatbelt an absolute misery!  Now, with the mifold, there's so much room, it's a pleasure!  As I said above, the seat is so compact (and adjustable) that we can easily give up some of that in order to make it a regular-use / semi-permanent seat.<br /><br />Also, I love that this adjusts for the child as opposed to the one-size-fits-all boosters that assume all children need to be boosted up a very precise amount.  The adjustable width of the lap-belt guides and adjustable height of the shoulder-belt strap makes this seat great.  Oh, one last thing...  this child seat shouldn't be called a &#34;booster&#34; at all...  it doesn't boost the child up but rather pulls the seatbelt down to position it correctly for the child...  awesome!",865,Yes,"Seat Type: booster

She can still fit in it, but I wanted to get her a new one as she's a longer and needs a little more room.

0,0,1,0,1,,"We bought this car seat from a different source after finding a better sale price, but thought I would share my thoughts here.<br /><br />Great, quality car seat that I felt met my high safety expectations, after a different high-end brand let me down (having had recalls regarding their China-made plastic and removal of their anti-rebound bar design in the new bases). I read many safety websites and comparisons regarding this car seat and other competitors', but seeing the actual results of the crash safety tests and the amount of G-Force transferred to the baby (this car seat rated among the best for dispersal of G-Force and impact energy) I felt happy going with it. The fabric looks like it will breath well and I'm impressed by the different inserts and quality of construction. The base is also narrower so it has a better fit if you want to try doing the three-across car seat setup in your truck or car. My husband loves that the seatbelt lockoff is a big panel that easily pushes down instead of those flimsy narrow lockoffs you see on other car seats. I love the European belt routing if you're installing without the base. Honestly, it's everything I've come to expect from a modern car seat.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The shoulder pads - someone else mentioned that the velcro is sewn on the inside where the fabric meets the harness belts, and it is still this way with the one we purchased. It catches on EVERYTHING, including the harness belts themselves at times. We tried different dolls and stuffed animals in the car seat for fun, my children enjoy it, but I have to be careful they don't get caught by this velcro. I can foresee issues with this and will probably remove them and use a different brand or something. They are great material other than this one design flaw.<br /><br />The canopy - it's a great UPF protected canopy made of breathable fabric, again quality materials. but it CLICKS loudly into place once fully extended, and I can see this startling a baby. Also, as many others have mentioned, the clearance for your hands is barely there while trying to carry. Honestly, I bought the car seat anyway knowing this and having seen it in many videos. I am not bothered by it as much because the car seat is so light and easy to handle that I don't need to do too much &#34;manhandling.&#34; I'm sure my husband might disagree with his bigger hands, but we will see.<br /><br />I'm happy I went with it, and look forward to lots of road trips!

We are pleased about that.  The seat clips into our car's latch system just fine.  The problem is Britax straps are not easy to adjust.

Our infant seat's straps were so much easier to put on and adjust than this convertible car seat's straps.  The button you have to push to loosen the straps is way, way down in a skinny tunnel -- it's kind of hard to access in a hurry.  The straps just seem to fall down where they are hard to get around your kid and the push button for unlatching the straps between the child's legs is hard to press.

I purchased this for him on sale just before Christmas and he loved the box it comes in just as much as his new ""booster seat"". We still use it as a car seat but I love the fact that he can use it for many years to come. I also love the two cup holders. We recently took a long distance car trip from Colorado to California and he was able to sleep in his Frontier comfortably without any issues. I really have no complaints about this car seat/booster seat except that, like another reviewer commented, it is a pain in the butt to pull off the cover to wash.

This has been annoying at the least and turned dangerous when my son was leaned back throwing up while sitting in the seat and I could not get the buckle separated for a good 30 seconds, that's a very long time in a situation like that, especially when it should take no more than 1 second to unsnap the buckle.  I continue to manipulate the plastic so that the male and female parts fit better but it continues to be very difficult to snap and unsnap this buckle. Something needs to be done by Graco to rectify this situation.",132,Yes,"Harness Type: The plastic on the horizontal buckles has warped, making it almost impossible to snap and unsnap them.",The harness buckles are easy to snap and unsnap.
